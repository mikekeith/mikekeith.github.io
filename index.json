C\u0026rsquo;est la vie - I have zero regrets and feel so much better for it.\nWhile I\u0026rsquo;m unsure I have the energy to return to a games industry utterly unrecognisable from the one I entered in 1995, I find myself more fascinated than ever by how we experience and engage with the world around us, and the role technology can play in encouraging and facilitating this. 12+ years of work and research in Augmented Reality, Spatial Computing and geographic/location based experiences have shown me that the Black Mirror-esque \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; powered AR glasses future pushed by the likes of meta is not the way we should be heading. There is a different future with tech respecting the user and environment while effectively getting out of the way that - in my opinion - is far more interesting and exciting.\nOver time I\u0026rsquo;ve cobbled together a document I aspirationally refer to as my manifesto (if only it were coherent enough to qualify as one) which brings together a whole range of fields I feel are interesting and connected.

The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.\nRetailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a new CD32 bundle.\nBattery maker Duracell had produced \u0026ldquo;The Duracell Challenge\u0026rdquo; - a free game which they hoped would \u0026ldquo;harness piracy\u0026rdquo; to spread\u0026hellip; there was prize money at stake and apparently every consumer who provided the game to an eventual winner would get a share. The interesting bit was that it was developed by The Mounties, who had been setup by none other than Mel Croucher (of Automata/Pi Man fame) to focus on interactive advertising. Oh, and it was PC only at the time of publication.\nThe UK was about to get a new terrestrial TV channel in the form of Channel 5, but the frequency could cause interference with Amiga RF cables.\nThe Monopolies and Mergers Commission slapped Nintendo and Sega on the wrists for: \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; setting high prices on software and unrealistically low prices on hardware, charging third parties too much to manufacture the games, wielding too much power over other publishers, outlawing rental when they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t and putting complex electronics into consoles to stop others producing software for them.\u0026rdquo; And those stern words were the extent of the punishment.\n\u0026ldquo;Coala\u0026rdquo; was a new helicopter flight sim from Empire.\nKompart Krew had provided some teasers of a bunch of new games they were publishing for the Amiga: \u0026ldquo;Tower of Souls\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Chess Through the Ages\u0026rdquo; (unreleased?), \u0026ldquo;Evil\u0026rsquo;s Doom\u0026rdquo; (developed by Croteam, unreleased) and \u0026ldquo;Turbo Trax\u0026rdquo;.\nA \u0026ldquo;rather raw-looking press release\u0026rdquo; from Cobra Developments heralded the release of \u0026ldquo;For The Love Of Money\u0026rdquo; for the CD32 which promised a \u0026ldquo;perfect balance of arcade action and adventure.\u0026rdquo; (unreleased?)\nGames industry trade show ECTS drew record crowds (8,500 over the three days), though the only stands with new Amiga wares were Team 17, Black Legend and Renegade. At the ECTS awards Bullfrog cleaned up, with \u0026ldquo;Magic Carpet\u0026rdquo; winning best home computer game and most original title of the year.\nBuried in the ECTS news was mention of Team 17 striking a deal with Ocean to provide more funds for development.\nLondon\u0026rsquo;s Science Museum had a new exhibition which would allow visitors to experience the \u0026ldquo;information superhighway\u0026rdquo;.\nA study by Plymouth University psychologist Mark Griffiths concluded that games could be beneficial for kids with \u0026ldquo;brain disorders, behavioural problems and arm injuries.\u0026rdquo; Apparently they could also cure \u0026ldquo;chronic nose pickers\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Spotlight Show which focussed on the Amiga was going ahead at London\u0026rsquo;s Novotel hotel on June 10th and 11th.

Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move was obviously concerning, The One were confident that the continued popularity of the Amiga would mean a positive outcome one way or another.\nThe winners of the ECTS awards were announced with \u0026ldquo;Doom\u0026rdquo; dominating, picking up \u0026ldquo;Computer Game of the Year\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Overall Game of the Year\u0026rdquo;. Viewers of BBC kids TV show \u0026ldquo;Alive and Kicking\u0026rdquo; chose \u0026ldquo;Frontier\u0026rdquo; for their award, \u0026ldquo;Rebel Assault\u0026rdquo; won \u0026ldquo;Best CD Game\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Syndicate\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Most Original Game\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps the most galling win as far as Amiga fans were concerned was that of the Atari Jaguar over the CD32 for \u0026ldquo;Best Hardware\u0026rdquo;.\nMersyside-base Spectacular Graphics had produced a coin-op cabinet for the arcades that could house a CD32.\nBT joined the games industry\u0026rsquo;s governing body ELPSA as they continued their push towards delivering games and movies over their network. While it was clear this would be some way off for the customers, they were pumping billions of pounds into their efforts and had setup an experiment with 70 employees in Ipswich. Oracle were providing their \u0026ldquo;Massively Parallel Processing\u0026rdquo; tech which would allow BT to keep just one digitised copy of game while serving thousands of players.\nThe CD32 continued to dominate CD software sales and several new titles were announced: \u0026ldquo;Rise of the Robots\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Cyberwar\u0026rdquo; (not released?), \u0026ldquo;Empire Soccer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sim City 2000\u0026rdquo;.\nThe World of Commodore show was making a comeback, slightly re-branded as World of Amiga and would take place at Wembley in November.\nThe CD sales figures put the CD32 at a 55.6% market share, PC 24.2%, Mega CD 18.3% and CD-i 1.1%.\nTeam 17 were about to release \u0026ldquo;Alien Breed II: Tower Assault\u0026rdquo; on floppy as well as a CD32 enhanced \u0026ldquo;Alien Breed II\u0026rdquo;. Other titles in development were an arcade strategy game called \u0026ldquo;King of Thieves\u0026rdquo; and a 10-pin bowling game.\nThe One were launching a club.. maybe? Or maybe it was just an excuse to explain away typos as coded messages.\nAnother month, another new CD32 bundle from Commodore. The Spectacular Voyage pack featured six games: \u0026ldquo;Microcosm\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Chaos Engine\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Wing Commander\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Dangerous Streets\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Diggers\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Oscar\u0026rdquo;. The price was Â£249.99.\n\u0026ldquo;P.I.D.\u0026rdquo; (Private Investigator Dollarlaly) was to be a racing game from Terramarque in the \u0026ldquo;Spy Hunter\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;APB\u0026rdquo; vein. It was unreleased.\nTucked away in a corner of Commodore\u0026rsquo;s ECTS stand was a prototype CD drive for the A1200 which caused a bit of a stir. However, there were no concrete plans for selling it at that point in time. David Pleasance felt the lack of MPEG video playback would reduce its appeal so they would need to find a compelling price point.\nDeveloper Stellar Genesis Agency were working on CD strategy game \u0026ldquo;Space Academy\u0026rdquo; for Mindscape (unreleased?).\nSpeaking of Mindscape\u0026hellip; they had just been bought by media giant Pearson for a cool Â£310 million. Pearson owned the likes of Thames TV, the Financial Times and Penguin Books.\nPOSH Marketing had developed a touchscreen for the CD32 which would find its way into information access terminals like those found at airports.\nThe Computer Graphics Expo was to take place at Wembley in November.\nNew Tek\u0026rsquo;s Video Toaster was finally going to get a UK release. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come cheap, mind you, as the software, A4000 and NTSC -\u0026gt; PAL converter would total around Â£12,000. There was also a brief mention of Commodore\u0026rsquo;s latest machine, the A4000 tower ( the \u0026ldquo;most powerful Amiga ever\u0026rdquo;) for Â£2999.99.\nDr Julia Rutkowska told the British Psychological Society that computer games can increase sociability rather than the commonly perceived idea that they resulted in loners.\nIt looked like Virgin Interactive Entertainment was being fought over by PolyGram and Disney. VIE was about to be listed on the US stock exchange and was part owned by Blockbuster Video\u0026hellip; who PolyGram had a majority stake in. Meanwhile the software house had a close relationship with Disney. At any rate, between that and the share flotation it was expected that Virgin would be getting a serious cash injection.\nComputer store chain Silica (described as \u0026ldquo;the Amiga\u0026rsquo;s most loyal high street supporter\u0026rdquo;) were to open 20 new shops.\nPinball was to meet RPGs in \u0026ldquo;Ultimate Pinball Quest\u0026rdquo; from Infogrammes.\nPeter Molyneux was to make an appearance at Level One in London to show off \u0026ldquo;Theme Park\u0026rdquo;.\nA sequel to Sensible Software\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Canon Fodder\u0026rdquo; was in the works, but it was early days (one level set in the desert) and they hadn\u0026rsquo;t decided on a name but were determined it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be called \u0026ldquo;Cannon Fodder 2\u0026rdquo;.\nFeatures #On this month\u0026rsquo;s two cover disks:\n\u0026ldquo;Armour-Geddon 2\u0026rdquo; Psygnosis (demo) \u0026ldquo;Digger\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Touch \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo; Go\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Gulp\u0026rdquo; ICE (demo) \u0026ldquo;Kung Fu Charlies\u0026rdquo; A big report on all the Amiga related announcements and gossip at ECTS.\nAn interview with Tony Bickley, a senior producer at US Gold, discussing the upcoming \u0026ldquo;World Cup \u0026lsquo;94\u0026rdquo;.\nGetting the in depth Work in Progress treatment this month:\n\u0026ldquo;Ruff ânâ Tumble\u0026rdquo; Renegade \u0026ldquo;Kick Off 3\u0026rdquo; Anco \u0026ldquo;Dragonstone\u0026rdquo; Core Design \u0026ldquo;Marvin\u0026rsquo;s Marvellous Adventure\u0026rdquo; Infernal Bytes \u0026ldquo;Super Stardust\u0026rdquo; Bloodhouse \u0026ldquo;Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity\u0026rdquo; Vulcan (a little odd this got a preview and a review in the same issue, but apparently the game was in development right up until the deadline) I didnât actually realise this regular feature was a development diary of âSensible World of Soccerâ until its fourth installment in this issue\nI thought it was a weirdly long drawn out series of interviews with Sensi. At any rate, the main thing this month was they had implemented The Season mode\u0026hellip; that and Jon and Chris Chapman flew to LA to meet with Virgin and, er, go to Disneyland.

The Voyage pack included âMicrocosmâ and âThe Chaos Engineâ, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for Â£299.99.\nCodemasters were bringing âCaptain Dynamoâ and the âDizzy CD Collectionâ to the CD32. The latter would contain ten games on one CD and cost Â£21.99. They were contemplating of also releasing âMicro Machinesâ and more on the console if sales were up to scratch.\nESP reckoned their âOracle Racing Systemâ software could predict winning race horses when the latest details were fed into its database.

Not only was it the number on CD32 title, but by mid March the CD32 had already captured 44% of CD software sales.\nAs reported last month, Domarkâs distribution manager Russell Ferrier was working with Middlesex University to establish a game design degree. Interestingly, applicants would be financed by software houses.\nAudiogenic got the rights to use the Wembley (as in, the stadium) name and were planning to release âWembley Rugby Leagueâ and âWembley International Soccerâ.\nExperts were skeptical of the hype over the âinformation superhighwayâ and predicted that itâd be quite some time before consumers would be shopping, banking, watching TV, downloading games and so on over âa single cable into the living roomâ. Apparently 77% of people had never used a fax, and 66% hadnât used a PC. That latter stat seems quite remarkable.\nThere was a story about how Tony Cooper met his fiancÃ© Janette in Portsmouth after he repaired her printer\u0026hellip; They were both Amiga fans which, I guess, is why it made the news page.\nVulcan claimed their new game, âValhalla and the Lord of the Infinityâ, was the âfirst ever speech adventureâ as it featured a vocabulary of over 1,000 words. It would come on at least five disks but they promised no disk swapping during levels.\nCastle Communications were bullish about the potential for Video CDs and announced three titles for release this month: âPavarotti Nessus Dormaâ, âThe History of Aviationâ and âDinosaurs Myth and Realityâ.\nFeatures #Three disks graced this monthâs cover featuring:\nâMr Nutzâ Ocean (demo) âOuchâ PD âClockwiserâ Rasputin (demo) âPugsyâ Psygnosis (demo) âTanx ânâ Stuffâ PD âXmas Timeâ PD âBansheeâ Core Design (demo) âSmidgeâ PD âWaggle O Mania 2â Team 17 Matt Broughton spent a day out filming with the crew and presenters of BBC2âs new computer show, âThe Netâ.

Well, technically those of us in NZ entered into a \u0026ldquo;consultation\u0026rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant. It was a sad end to what had been an intense (in good and bad ways) but incredible 7.5 years for me.\nI was - to my knowledge - the first games industry person to join the company when the headcount was 20-ish. While my primary focus was on creating Mixed Reality games/experiences, I was very fortunate to get to work closely with people on teams throughout the company from all manner of fields, software and hardware. Headpose, world reconstruction, hand tracking, eye tracking, 6dof totems, object recognition, optics, audio algorithms, OS, SDK, deep learning.. the list goes on. I even maintained our prototype devices, manually re- calibrating and performing occasional surgery on them. It was all absolutely fascinating.\nMy team were always the first to take bleeding edge in-development platform features and integrate them into our experiences to help iron out issues and guide the API design. We worked with pretty much every device revision, from bare boards through to final wearables. While this was a challenging endeavour it was hugely beneficial to the platform and the company as whole.\nAs for the games we created, we knew right from the very start that Mixed Reality was going to provide some significant new challenges. The primary one being that every user/player will have a unique experience since we merge virtual content with the real world. The implications of this are huge and impacts everything from AI and navigation, through to UX (where to place interactive objects and what does that interaction even look like), physics, sound design and more. All of our systems had to be designed with these challenges in mind. \u0026ldquo;Invaders\u0026rdquo; pushed the platform further than any other experience.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s so much more I could ramble on about - it was 7.5 years spent working with some of the smartest, most talented people on the planet. I learned so much and am immensely proud of what we achieved. I really hope the things we were working on see the light of day - they were awesome and very, very fun.\nMake no bones about it, AR/MR is going to be huge - it will change everything.

One tidbit that stood out was that Lew Eggebrecht, VP of Engineering, promised 100 titles available at launch this month. The console would retail for $399, with the FMV cart costing an addition $250. Meanwhile, the US would get its first dedicated monthly Amiga mag in \u0026ldquo;Amiga Game Zone\u0026rdquo;.

(It didn\u0026rsquo;t happen)\nWhile England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, Virgin were keen to join with Adidas to sponsor a new initiative to promote youth footballing skills.\nThe main Commodore news this month was the release of the full motion video cartridge for the CD32, which they hoped would bring more customers to the machine by offering MPEG1 movies and music videos. The add-on cost a cool Â£199.99. They also took out their famous \u0026ldquo;To Be This Good Will Take Sega Ages\u0026rdquo; billboard right across from Sega\u0026rsquo;s UK HQ.\nGiven all the doom and gloom surrounding the Amiga, it was interesting to note that the Amiga remained the number one games computer over the Christmas period, accounting for 57.5% of all software sold. The PC was gaining, however. The biggest titles were \u0026ldquo;Mortal Kombat\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Frontier\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cannon Fodder\u0026rdquo; with Virgin raking in an impressive 15% of the market by itself.\n109 CD32s had been installed in the London Transport Museum, delivering text, animation, video and sound fx for a touch screen experience.\nWith the rumblings of a government imposed ratings scheme on the horizon, Alternative took the initiative and had many of its own games classified with a Uc label, signifying they were suitable for children. They also updated \u0026ldquo;Jetstrike\u0026rdquo; and now claimed that it was the first ever \u0026ldquo;never ending computer game\u0026rdquo; thanks to additional missions/weapons/data supplied via magazine coverdisks etc. Hmm.\nSystem 3 were to releases five of their Amiga titles for the CD32: \u0026ldquo;Putty\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;International Karate\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Last Ninja 3\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Flimbo\u0026rsquo;s Quest\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Myth\u0026rdquo;.\nVirgin Interactive had spun out Virgin Sound and Vision which would focus on non-gaming CD-ROM software, like education, interactive music and reference applications.\nWhile 20th Century Fox was no stranger to games, licensing out the likes of The Simpsons and Aliens to other software houses, rumour was they were about to start their own games division.\nAccording to a survey by BMRB International (who?) 76% of parents felt their kids spent too much time playing games, with 60% thinking it would have harmful consequences.\nKaraoke specialist Arbiter were about to release 2,000 singalong CDs for the CD32.

Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration work be finished before a single line of code was written.. hmm.\nThe much delayed rather gorgeous isometric action adventure \u0026ldquo;Darkmere\u0026rdquo; was about to arrive. Core\u0026rsquo;s Jeremy Smith explained the lengthy development as being the result of a single programmer who managed to get 40% of the code done before realising the design was too ambitious. That resulted in a re- shuffle and the new team re-writing it from scratch.\nA row was brewing between software houses and distributors. CDs were cheaper to produce when meant narrowing the margin the distributors received, so they reacted by refusing to take them.\nELPSA (European Leisure Software Publisher\u0026rsquo;s Association) was looking to introduce a standardised age ratings scheme. They were hoping for it to come into effect from 1st of May, and were keen to get it established before the government stepped in with its own scheme.\nThere was rather grim news from Commodore\u0026rsquo;s US parent company which had posted a massive $365.5 million loss in the year ending June 1993. Would there be implications for Commodore UK?\nSoftware house The Sales Curve were rebranding as SCI.\nGame stores were popping up everywhere, it seemed. HMV had opened 40 during 1993 (they had 10 to start with) and Game were looking to add another 30 (bringing their total up to almost 60). Likewise, northern chain Next Level planned to take its current 5 stores up to 50.\nThere was an apology for last month\u0026rsquo;s Next Month page which, they said, was meant as a light hearted jest, but apparently caused some offence.\nThe upcoming film featuring Wesley Snipes as Marvel\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Shadow\u0026rdquo; was tipped to be the big blockbuster of the summer.. so naturally The One wondered which publisher would snap up the game rights.\nThe Tolt d\u0026rsquo;Or awards were held in Paris, with Team 17 winning \u0026ldquo;Best Action Game\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;Alien Breed II\u0026rdquo; and Ocean\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mr Nutz\u0026rdquo; picking up \u0026ldquo;Best Platform Game\u0026rdquo;.\nA rather low turnout of 35,828 people for the Future Entertainment Show held at London\u0026rsquo;s Olympia meant plans for any further shows were at risk.\nVirgin dropped the price of Dino Dini\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Goal!\u0026rdquo; by 5 quid to Â£19.99.\nIn a rather amusing turn of events..

As always, David pulled no punches, referring to the \u0026ldquo;A500/A500+/A600 farce\u0026rdquo; which they were still trying to shake off. He insisted there would be no new computer between the A1200 and A4000 (there had been rumours of an A1400) to try prevent potential customers holding out for the next model.

Iâve no idea how they did it but - by God! - Iâm glad they did.â âGlobduleâ Ex Animo Design/Psygnosis - 82% âAt last - a platform game (or âsplatformâ, as Psygnosis are touting it) with a degree of originality.

Specifically the two games appear very similar; despite the nice parallax backdrops, the graphics have a slightly dated look (circa 1989, Iâd say), the sound appears to have been transplanted straight across to the sequel and the gameplay is just more hacking-ânâ-slashing mayhem.â âThe Settlersâ Blue Byte - 90% âTo put it succinctly, The Settlers is one of the most impressive games ever to have come out of Germany.

Sheer, unadulterated brilliance. Cannon Fodder is quite simply one of the best strategy/action/shoot-âem-ups to appear for ages.â âWonder Dogâ Core Design - 84% âOkay, Wonder Dog is nothing new. The only revolutionary thing about is that you canât kill the baddies by jumping on their heads, which has to be something of an innovation for a platform game these days. So why has it been rated so highly? Well, for starters itâs supremely playable.â âLiberation: Captive 2â Byte Engineers/Mindscape - 94% âThank God - game that finally does the CD32 justice. The simple fact of the matter is that Liberation is quite possibly the best game Iâve ever played - itâs so good it makes Frontier look like a PD text adventure.â ","date":"17 December 2019","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2019/12/17/this-month-in-the-one-93/","section":"","summary":"","title":"This month in...

To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live \u0026lsquo;93 exhibition and an upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live \u0026lsquo;93 was such a big hit that Commodore had already booked its presence at next year\u0026rsquo;s event.

The One went along to see what was going on in the game development world. There was a growing concern over the ever increasing budgets and team sizes required for producing new games - gone were the days of the bedroom coder knocking out games in a few months. In addition to that the industry had attracted the attention of non- gaming titans like Time-Warner, 20th Century Fox and IBM. Other stories from Develop covered in this section:\nManga artist Satomi Mikuriya was unhappy at the number of trees sacrificed to produce the comics he drew for and had come up with a CD authoring system that would allow an entire animated comic CD to be created in mere hours and cost less than Â£3000.

He feared that game developers weren\u0026rsquo;t ready for such a seismic shift which could result in demand for traditional skills falling by the way side, replaced by \u0026ldquo;emotional realism, storytelling and editing.\u0026rdquo;\nChris Crawford (creator of games like \u0026ldquo;Balance of Power\u0026rdquo;, and founder of the Computer Game Developers Conference) warned devs that \u0026ldquo;unless we spend more time developing more subtle scenarios than Kill, Slash and Score, we\u0026rsquo;ll all have lost interest in games by the time we\u0026rsquo;re 25 or older\u0026rdquo;. Hmm. He was working on a new game and had spent over two years just on the facial animation.

Well\u0026hellip; life decided to intervene which resulted in a lot less time to work on the game than I had hoped. But I have managed to tick off a few things on the long to-do list\u0026hellip;\nItem Activation #The main - and, I must admit, only - playing facing addition is items that need to be activated before they can be matched. Activation occurs when a neighbour - regardless of colour - is matched and removed. I\u0026rsquo;ve reserved the 4th bit to indicate whether an item requires activation, which means I have 7 possible item types. So far I\u0026rsquo;m only using 4, so I think this will be enough. However, I should be able to take the 5th bit to give 15 item types (each with an unactivated variant) if need be.\nThe item bits at present are:\n.const ITEM_TYPE_BITS = %00001111 .const ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION = %00001000 .const ITEM_MOVING = %00100000 .const ITEM_DONT_DRAW = %01000000 .enum { ITEM_TYPE_NONE = 0, ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL = 1, ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL = 2, ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL = 3, ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL = 4, ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_1 = 5, ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_2 = 6, ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_3 = 7, ITEM_TYPE_NONE_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_NONE + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION, ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION, ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION, ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION, ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL_UNACTIVATED =ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION, ITEM_NUM_TYPES = 13 } Interpolation #Up until a couple of months ago, the code to handle the sprite movement when the player fires an item was specific to that use case. Rather than having items jump immediately to their new positions when neighbours are removed, I want to utilise this sprite iterpolation to make it nice and smooth. So the first step in the process was to refactor the code into something more generic.\nThe resulting routines are super simplistic - the interpolation speeds are specified as pixels per update (whole pixels only), and the X and Y coordinates are interpolated at the same speed, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t look great under some circumstances. I may revisit this in the future.\nThe following clip shows this code in action:\ntest_lerp: :test_push_lerp(0, 0, 100, 200, 1) :test_push_lerp(200, 0, 50, 200, 2) :test_push_lerp(20, 0, 70, 200, 3) :test_push_lerp(60, 0, 40, 200, 4) :test_push_lerp(90, 0, 120, 200, 5) :test_push_lerp(0, 0, 100, 200, 1) :test_push_lerp(200, 0, 50, 200, 2) :test_push_lerp(20, 0, 70, 200, 3) :test_push_lerp(60, 0, 40, 200, 4) :test_push_lerp(90, 0, 120, 200, 5) !loop: :start_frame_update(1, !profiling) jsr item_lerper.tick where the test_push_lerp parameters are the start X \u0026amp; Y, target X \u0026amp; Y and colour.\nBugs #While writing the activation and interpolation code, I ran into two separate bugs that had me scatching my head for an embarassingly long time.\nThe first occurred when matched items were being removed - occasionally the bottom left item would disappear when it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. I suspected this had something to do with the new code which finds any neighbours of an item being removed and activates them. The 64 Debugger was a huge help in tracking the culprit down, especially since it recently added the ability to read KickAssembler debug symbols. This is brilliant as it gives you your full source code along side the instructions:\nSure enough the bug was in the routine to find occupied neighbours - if there were no neighbours, I was neglecting to set the count of neighbours found to zero. This meant it would try to activate whatever items happened to be lying around in a buffer.\nThe second bug was considerably harder to find\u0026hellip;\nThe Perils of Macros #KickAssembler has a rich scripting language to assist with creating code and data. For my first pass on the interpolation routines, I relied heavily on the scripting - particularly macros and pseudocommands. This made things like operating over a buffer of data structures very straightforward, for example:\n.for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; lerping_items_count; i++) { lda lerping_items[i].active beq !skip+ :lerp(lerping_items[i].current_x, lerping_items[i].target_x, ITEM_DROP_SPEED, lerping_items[i].active) :lerp(lerping_items[i].current_y, lerping_items[i].target_y, ITEM_DROP_SPEED, lerping_items[i].active) :update_lerping_item_sprite(i) .... But then I ran into a bug where some interpolating items would just disappear when a certain number had been queued. What made this particularly difficult to debug was the reliance on macros and pseudocommands. Because I was calling several macros, which in turn called other macros and pseudocommands, and all of this was wrapped in a for loop, the amount of actual code output was huge. I found stepping through all this code tedious and confusing - particularly since the issue only appeared towards the end of the interpolating items buffer.\nThe cause turned out to be a classic mixup between an address and the size of a buffer. In the routine to find a free interpolating item to use, I loop over all the items in the buffer to see if there is one that isn\u0026rsquo;t active:\nget_free_lerping_item_offset: ldx #0 !loop: lda lerping_items,X beq !found_free+ txa clc adc #lerping_item_size() cmp #lerping_items_end // \u0026lt;---- d'oh bcs !none_free+ tax jmp !loop- !found_free: rts !none_free: ldx #255 rts lerping_items_end happens to be the memory address immediately after the lerping items buffer. What I wanted, of course, was to compare the current offset to the size of the buffer.\nKickAssembler 5 #As well as the ability to output full symbols/source for use in the C64 Debugger, there are a number of other nice improvements in KickAssembler 5. However, the changes to escape characters in strings broke the useful unit test framework 64spec. I\u0026rsquo;ve submitted a pull request that fixes these errors.\n","date":"24 February 2019","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2019/2/24/diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Diary of a Game: Part 4 - Item Activation, Interpolation and...

Unlike the second instalment which was effectively tweaks and improvements to the original\u0026rsquo;s codebase, this one was re-coded from the ground up. Would it be able to take back the crown from \u0026ldquo;Sensible Soccer\u0026rdquo; ?\nSpeaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn\u0026rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and \u0026ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1\u0026rdquo; was due out next month.

Creative Materials was in charge of the \u0026ldquo;Street Fighter 2\u0026rdquo; Amiga port and the screens they released looked promising. Could it actually best the SNES version? (of course not - it wasn\u0026rsquo;t terrible, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a patch on the SNES).\nMicroprose were working on \u0026ldquo;Gunship 2000\u0026rdquo;, a follow up to their popular helicopter sim.

The publisher had also picked up the team from defunct Strangeways Software who were now working on a game called \u0026ldquo;Ruff \u0026amp; Tumble\u0026rdquo;.

Well, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve had a decent excuse.\nDespite being embarassingly tardy with writing updates, some progress has been made. This is the current state of the game:\nSprites #I\u0026rsquo;ve continued to stick with the C64\u0026rsquo;s standard character mode - I may well switch to the multicolour character mode, but a character approach seems to be working well. In order to draw the overlapping rows of items on the board, I just change the horizontal scroll value every 8 lines which means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to faff about with creating a bunch of extra in-between chars. The downside to this is that as items/balls/whatever fall down, they jump left and right.\nSprites aren\u0026rsquo;t affected by the scroll registers, so now when an item drops from the top what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing is a sprite rather than a character. Setting up the sprite code was straightforward and as always I highly recommend checking out 64bites.com.\nThe first step was to be able to position sprites over any of the board\u0026rsquo;s cells. The way the logic for the items works is similar to a cellular automaton, in that each board cell looks at its contents and the contents of its neighbours, and then decides what the next state should be. This means that things move in character sized jumps. So once I was able to cover any item with a sprite as it dropped down, I could start on making this look nice and pixely smooth.\nRoughly, the way it now works is:\nCreate an item at the top, hide it and replace it with a sprite Tick the item (does it drop down or is it blocked?) If it\u0026rsquo;s position did change, start a linear interpolation between the current sprite position and the item\u0026rsquo;s new position. Repeat the interpolation until the sprite has arrived. Repeat step 2. Currently this is only used for the item that is fired from the top, but one of the things on my todo list is to expand it to include items when they collapse.\nCharacter Animations #One of the most interesting things I\u0026rsquo;ve found while working on this is just how overly confident I am that I know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing when when approaching certain straightforward tasks. It ended up taking me about 6-8 hours split over several nights to get a simple system for animating arbitrary characters integrated\u0026hellip; so many times I was sure I had the answer only to find it was a deadend. To be fair, the difficulty is not that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what was needed, it was taking it and cramming into the constraints of the 6510.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve ended up with an animation pool that take animation sequences and then play them appropriately.\nThe animation pool along with an example sequence (used when items are matched \u0026amp; removed) looks like:\n.macro animation_frame(char, frame_dur) { character: .byte char // character to display frame_duration: .byte frame_dur // how long to show it for } animation_sequence3: { num_frames: .byte 6 animation_frame1: { :animation_frame(CIRCLE_FILLED_CHAR, 3) } animation_frame2: { :animation_frame(CIRCLE_OUTLINE_CHAR, 3) } animation_frame3: { :animation_frame(ASTERISK_CHAR, 3) } animation_frame4: { :animation_frame(PLUS_CHAR, 3) } animation_frame5: { :animation_frame(PERIOD_CHAR, 3) } animation_frame6: { :animation_frame(BLANK_CHAR, 1) } } animation_pool: .for(var i = 0; i \u0026lt; ANIMATION_POOL_SIZE; i++) { animation_item: { loop_count: .byte 0 // how many loops left - 255 = forever dest: .word 0 // screen offset for where to draw character: .byte 0 // current character current_frame: .byte 0 // current frame in the sequence frame_time_left: .byte 0 // how long left for the current frame sequence: .word 0 // pointer to the sequence data flags: .byte 0 // flags for the anim animation_item_end: } } animation_pool_end: This gives me a nice, flexible system which I can use to animate any character on the screen. I\u0026rsquo;ve been a bit sloppy with my memory usage, but if I run out of RAM there is some easy low hanging fruit to tackle (famous last words!).\nInput #Player input is super, super simple in this game - it\u0026rsquo;s literally just one button. For the time being I\u0026rsquo;m only reading the spacebar state, but I will extend that to joystick buttons and possibly other inputs. Consequently the code is straightforward:\n.macro update_spacebar_state(previous_spacebar_state, spacebar_state) { lda spacebar_state sta previous_spacebar_state lda #%01111111 // check for space bar pressed sta $dc00 lda $dc01 and #%00010000 sta spacebar_state } Even though I\u0026rsquo;d been using raster interrupts to trigger the scroll register changes since the early days, I was still always making sure to call the system IRQ handler when I was done. You can see just how heavy this default handler is in this clip where it screws up drawing when the spacebar is pressed:\nHowever I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I don\u0026rsquo;t need that kernal functionality, so now I skip the system handler. Just make sure to restore the registers when you exit your handler, e.g:\n.macro scroll_irq_last(scroll_value) { // update scroll register lda screen_control_register2 and #%11111000 ora #scroll_value sta screen_control_register2 // acknowldge the interrupt lda #%00000001 sta vic2_interrupt_status_register // restore the registers pla tay pla tax pla rti } What Next? #Top of the todo list is special items. Unlike the regular coloured balls, these will have particular behaviours like bubbles that disappear when a neighbouring cell becomes empty, or ones that can\u0026rsquo;t be removed by matching but turn into regular balls when directly hit.\n","date":"15 October 2018","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2018/10/15/diary-of-a-game-part-3-sprites-character-animation-and-input/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Diary of a Game: Part 3 - Sprites, Character Animation and Input"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/dr-grordborts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dr Grordbort's"},{"content":" Let\u0026rsquo;s take a little break from looking back to the past and cast our gaze towards the tech of the present and future\u0026hellip;\nSome (almost) 6 years ago I was approached to help out with a prototype Weta Workshop was developing with a highly secretive tech start up called Magic Leap. Workshop was well known, especially here in NZ, but there was little to no info out there about the latter. Nevertheless it sounded intriguing and I figured why not.. I was the first and - for 6 months - only programmer on the project which would grow and transform over the coming years into Dr Grordbort\u0026rsquo;s Invaders. I was also the first games industry person at Magic Leap. Quite amazing to think how far things have come since those early days. The NZ studio has grown to around 50 people, and my job entails very little programming these days - we\u0026rsquo;ve been fortunate to hire a bunch of far more talented people.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s made the journey especially interesting is that we weren\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; creating a game, but were heavily involved with building the platform - hardware and software. It\u0026rsquo;s been a genuinely fascinating and exciting process and I\u0026rsquo;ve been so fortunate to work with so many brilliant people across all disciplines on teams around the world.\nMagic Leap One Creator Edition - our first small step - was released in August and it\u0026rsquo;s been pretty awesome to see the cool things developers have already done with it.\nâMagic Leap is attempting to build the computer and operating system that comes after our laptops, smartphones and TVs. Itâs a bold, exciting, petrifying vision of the future.â Wall Street Journal\nâThis sensation of coexisting with digital objects is remarkable, and game developers should be excited about the possibilities of this tech.â Gamasutra\nAnd then last week we released Dr Grordbort\u0026rsquo;s Invaders.\nThis is just the beginning - the tech enabling Mixed Reality is progressing at a rapid pace, and will only accelerate over the coming months \u0026amp; years. There is a lot for game devs to be excited about here - the rule book has been torn up, and it\u0026rsquo;s time to start learning again.\n","date":"14 October 2018","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2018/10/15/of-magic-leap-amp-dr-grordborts/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Of Magic Leap \u0026 Dr Grordbort's"},{"content":" In this month\u0026rsquo;s editorial, The Boss Upstairs reflected on the success of the Special Reserve and Official Secrets clubs.

The One for Amiga was now just \u0026ldquo;The One\u0026rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of \u0026ldquo;special interviews\u0026rdquo; because the latter was \u0026ldquo;simply more interesting\u0026rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may have gone a little easy on games). Jim Douglas was the new editor, and Gary Whitta returned as staff writer.\nKonami snagged the rights to the \u0026ldquo;Batman Returns\u0026rdquo; game, which would be developed by Rage, a new company risen from the ashes of Special FX (which had been formed by ex-Ocean folk).\nCommodore were about to launch a new Amiga, the A600. There didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a whole lot to get excited about with the main new feature being a \u0026ldquo;Smart Card\u0026rdquo; slot. Software publishers could include an \u0026ldquo;uncopiable card\u0026rdquo; along with floppies for extra copy protection\u0026hellip; but would any publishers actually do this? The A600 turned out to be one of the biggest, most baffling mis-steps of a company that had squandered the amazing lead the Amiga had given it 7 years earlier.\n\u0026ldquo;The Lawnmower Man\u0026rdquo; looked like it could be one of this Summer\u0026rsquo;s blockbusters and The Sales Curve had acquired the game license (though I can\u0026rsquo;t find evidence it was released).\nIn the aftermath of Robert Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s death and the subsequent implosion of his empire, Acclaim had bought Renegade and this month saw the news that the Image Works label would continue (for now). The American publisher also had the rights to the eagerly awaited movie, \u0026ldquo;Aliens 3\u0026rdquo;.\nAs mentioned above, developer Special FX had closed up shop and the team had re-formed as Rage. While they would continue to develop games for other software houses (though, interestingly enough, specifically not Ocean) they planned to publish titles themselves. 3D footie game \u0026ldquo;Striker\u0026rdquo; was the first game on the way.\nSeveral developers teased the possibility of sequels to classic games. Andrew Braybrook confirmed he was working on \u0026ldquo;Uridium 2\u0026rdquo;, while Archer Maclean was pondering either \u0026ldquo;Snooker 2\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;IK+ Deluxe\u0026rdquo;, and Jez San said preliminary design work on \u0026ldquo;Starglider 3\u0026rdquo; had been done and that they were looking for \u0026ldquo;the right deal\u0026rdquo;. Only the first of those would see the light of day. Team 17 were following up \u0026ldquo;Project X\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Alien Breed\u0026rdquo; (The One thought this was a sequel) and Titus had \u0026ldquo;Blues Brothers 2\u0026rdquo; on the way (though it was not released).\nMaxis had found huge success with \u0026ldquo;Sim City\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sim Earth\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Sim Ant\u0026rdquo; had just been released, and the next Sim game was to be \u0026ldquo;Sim Body\u0026rdquo; (simulation of the human body) and \u0026ldquo;Sim Soap\u0026rdquo; - a simulation of the day to day happenings on the set of a soap opera. Neither of which appeared.\nPublisher Electronic Zoo - perhaps best known for \u0026ldquo;Battle Squadron\u0026rdquo; - shut up shop.\nWhile US Gold had the official rights to the Barcelona Olympics, Psygnosis were planning one of their own. Written by Teque London, it promised digitised graphics of real athletes to produce \u0026ldquo;authentic action\u0026rdquo;.\nGremlin had a couple of treats in store for racing fans. Magnetic Fields was working on \u0026ldquo;Lotus: The Final Challenge\u0026rdquo;, which would feature a track designer, and while not much was known about the \u0026ldquo;Nigel Mansell\u0026rdquo; game, apparently the \u0026ldquo;early road routines\u0026rdquo; were \u0026ldquo;some of the most spectacular ever seen.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a bid to prevent other developers knicking their ideas, there would be no previews or in-development pieces of the next instalment in Dino Dini\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Kick Off\u0026rdquo; series, \u0026ldquo;Kick Off 3\u0026rdquo;. Or at least that\u0026rsquo;s the excuse they gave for keeping it under wraps. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it started out this way, but this one was not written by Dino.\nHelicopter shoot-em up \u0026ldquo;Apocalypse\u0026rdquo; looked to be yet another victim of the Mirrorsoft collapse, as doubts grew that it would see the light of day due to legal wranglings over ownership and the break up of the team.\nWith the European Championships coming up, publishers were looking to cash in with no less than 8 football games due to hit the Amiga. US Gold took a slightly different tack in launching a compilation call \u0026ldquo;The Lineker Collection\u0026rdquo; which included \u0026ldquo;Italy 1990\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hot Shot\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Microprose International Soccer Challenge\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Golden Joystick winners were:\n16-Bit Game of the Year: \u0026ldquo;Heimdall\u0026rdquo; Core Design Overall Game of the Year: Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega) Programmer of the Year: Archer Maclean Software House of the Year: Electronic Arts Best Graphics: \u0026ldquo;Heimdall\u0026rdquo; Core Design Best Soundtrack: \u0026ldquo;The Secret of Monkey Island\u0026rdquo; Lucasfim/US Gold Best Simulation: \u0026ldquo;Jimmy White\u0026rsquo;s Whirlwind Snooker\u0026rdquo; Virgin Best Coin-Op Conversion: \u0026ldquo;Toki\u0026rdquo; Ocean Sensible Software\u0026rsquo;s upcoming \u0026ldquo;Sensible Soccer\u0026rdquo; had been signed to Renegade, not Ocean as reported in last month\u0026rsquo;s issue. While apparently being the most previewed title of the year, one new tidbit was popstar Captain Sensible would be on music duties.\nThe Computer Shopper Show was to take place at Olympia in May.

The One '92"},{"content":"Once again a depressing amount of time has passed since my last update. Given what\u0026rsquo;s on my plate workwise over the next few months I suspect the sporadic nature of my posts will continue. Thankfully I have continued to find time to chip away at the game, and some progress has been made.\nAfter I managed to get a super rough first pass of the (very) initial base of the game done (with the balls/bubbles/whatever falling down the board and stacking up correctly), the next thing to tackle was the colour matching. This ended up being a rather humbling endeavour as my initial confidence met the realities of my inexperience with 6502 coding.\nThe first step was get the connecting neighbours for each any given cell on the board, which was straightforward enough.\nFinding the neighbours of each cell.\nWith a simple routine to return a list of neighbours for a given cell, I could move on to figuring out all of the matching connected items. This is where things got a little complicated. The board on which the items appear can be viewed as a graph/network of connected nodes. Most nodes have up to 6 neighbours, whereas those on the edges \u0026amp; corners of the board have up to 2, 3 or 4 depending on their position. Chains of connected items can potentially use every cell on the board. So I decided to use a basic graph/network search, which looks something like \u0026hellip;\nFor a given item:\nPush the item onto the \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo; stack (items that need to be visited) While the open stack has items on it: Pop an item Mark it as matched \u0026amp; visited Get a list of matching neighbours Iterate through each neighbour, and if they haven\u0026rsquo;t been visited then push them onto the open stack. Go to step 2 While this is the kind of thing I\u0026rsquo;ve done many times in more fully featured languages, I really struggled to get my head around doing it with 6502. The fact that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have decent chunks of time to sit down and focus on it didn\u0026rsquo;t help. I eventually got there, though, and the moment where it finally worked was one of the most satisfying achievements for me in recent times, which is somewhat amusing.\nTesting the matching chains of items.\nWhat this all highlighted for me was that I really needed to spend some time improving my testing and debugging process. The C64Debugger was useful, though I just can not seem to get it to load symbols - I keep meaning to download the source and have a poke around. I had never really explored debugging in VICE, but I found this blog post a great introduction. Once I realised I could load symbols, VICE was a huge help (I had previously been manually printing out addresses at compile time in KickAssembler).\nBut as I went back to refactor and optimise routines I found myself getting pretty frustrated at subtle bugs creeping in which became difficult to track down. Thankfully there is a nice unit test solution for the C64. Yes, unit testing on the C64. Michael Taszycki of the excellent 64Bites video series has created the 64spec framework, which allows you to setup unit tests and run them on the 64 (or in an emulator). This now allows me to make changes and have some confidence that if I break anything I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to catch it early.\nOne of unit tests. I have multiple files for each major component.\nOh dear, something went wrong somewhere. Time to debug.\nAnd so now things are at the point where balls/bubbles/whatever fall down, stack up and get removed when chains of 3+ matching items are found. Next on my plate is some more refactoring and optimisation, then I need to tackle using sprites for the moving items so they look a little less crap.\n","date":"20 May 2018","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2018/5/20/diary-of-a-game-part-2-matching-and-testing/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Diary of a Game: Part 2 - Matching and Testing"},{"content":" While they didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal actual subscription figures, the situation sounded a bit grim - the membership fee was to increase and there was a plea for readers to spread the word.\nMeanwhile the helpline seemed to have switched to be a largely answering machine based service, and there was a request for solutions to a bunch of big recent adventures.\nIn this issue:\nThe news included details of several upcoming adventures from Electronic Arts and Gary Gygax consulting for Infogrames on \u0026ldquo;Drakkhen\u0026rdquo;.

Chris Wilkins, Roger Kean and Oli Frey have teamed up once again, this time to resurrect Crash\u0026rsquo;s sister mag, Zzap!64, for an annual due out towards the end of the year.\nI must admit I didn\u0026rsquo;t read the Kickstarter pitch or even watch the video before backing it as there was no question in my mind, so it was only through seeing people discussing it online that I realised that the likes of Mel Croucher, Julian Rignall and Robin Hogg were also involved. If that wasn\u0026rsquo;t reason enough to back it, there\u0026rsquo;s the return of the White Wizard adventure section (including an interview with Scott Adams), Simon Butler casting his over C64 fan art, Paul Rand on a day in the life of producing Zzap!64 back in the day, and perhaps most interestingly, a gathering of old school legends (Andrew Braybrook and Archer Maclean were mentioned) reminiscing about the C64 over a pint. The articles that have stuck in my mind from when I was a regular Zzap!64 reader were where they gathered a few industry greats to shoot the breeze (e.g. The Musicians Ball).\nAt the time of writing - a mere 2 days after it launched - the Â£20,000 target has been smashed, with almost Â£35,000 pledged. The first stretch goal has been met, and I have my fingers crossed the next one at Â£40,000 (a calendar) won\u0026rsquo;t be too far away.\n","date":"28 April 2018","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2018/4/29/zzap64-annual-2019-kickstarter-launched/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Zzap!64 Annual 2019 Kickstarter launched"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/zzap64/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zzap64"},{"content":" News #It seemed this would be the final issue for the whole editorial crew as they were being replaced by the folk from \u0026ldquo;ex-sister magazine ACE\u0026rdquo;. Such a drastic move must\u0026rsquo;ve been a bitter pill to swallow, but it did mean the return of Gary Whitta.\nTV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Gamesmaster\u0026rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during its first season. While there had been no official confirmation, it looked likely to return. Yorkshire Television were producing a show with Andy Crane that was \u0026ldquo;more Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s World than Gamesmaster\u0026rdquo;, and the BBC\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;100 Per Cent\u0026rdquo; and ITV\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Video View\u0026rdquo; were apparently adding gaming content.\nNew software house Mirage had the bold ambition to be \u0026ldquo;like Sierra and Microprose put together\u0026hellip; only 10 times better.\u0026rdquo; The man at the helm was Peter Jones, who had been \u0026ldquo;the force behind\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;Midwinter\u0026rdquo; series and \u0026ldquo;the more recent Sierra hits\u0026rdquo;. Hard not to raise an eyebrow over those claims.\nIn a somewhat out of character move, Thalamus - publisher of many solid shoot \u0026rsquo;em ups - had struck a deal with Arsenal to develop \u0026ldquo;Arsenal F.C. The Computer Game\u0026rdquo;. The game was never released. They also announced the formation of their fan club, offering members new product info and a newsletter.\nEmpire released \u0026ldquo;Winners\u0026rdquo;, a compilation featuring \u0026ldquo;Space Ace\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Populous\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Kick Off 2\u0026rdquo;and \u0026ldquo;Pipemania\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Deliverance\u0026rdquo; from 21st Century Entertainment - sequel to the well received \u0026ldquo;Stormlord\u0026rdquo; - was to hit the shelves next month.\nThe European Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) had declared April 13th National Play a Game Day. Details were scant, but proceeds would go to an as yet unnamed charity.\nIn what seemed like quite a coup, Mindscape had managed to get the home computer rights to Mario from Nintendo\u0026hellip; except the titles would be edutainment, the first of which being \u0026ldquo;Mario Is Missing\u0026rdquo; (not released on the Amiga).\nThe \u0026ldquo;long running\u0026rdquo; series of 16-bit Computer Shows would return on July 10th through to the 12th. The previous one boasted 32,000 visitors.\nOne of the magazine\u0026rsquo;s own, Jools Watsham, was behind a new platformer called \u0026ldquo;Impossible World\u0026rdquo; that promised to be \u0026ldquo;the home computer\u0026rsquo;s answer to Sonic and Mario\u0026hellip; only much, much better!\u0026rdquo;. While they were aiming for a Christmas release, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it was ever finished.\nFollowing last month\u0026rsquo;s rather scathing review of \u0026ldquo;Tip Off\u0026rdquo;, The One published an apology for stating it was as bug ridden as Anco\u0026rsquo;s previous game\u0026ldquo;Kick Off\u0026rdquo; (which wasn\u0026rsquo;t buggy). Furthermore, Dino Dini wanted it made clear that he had nothing to do with the basketball game.\nFlight sim fans could look forward to two more from Microprose: \u0026ldquo;B17 Flying Fortress\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;A.T.A.C.\u0026rdquo; (the latter was not released).\nRenegade were packaging up all of the Bitmap Brothers\u0026rsquo;s games into two compilations. Volume one would feature \u0026ldquo;Xenon\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Cadaver\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Speedball 2\u0026rdquo;, followed by volume two with \u0026ldquo;Speedball\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Xenon 2\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gods\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Kidz Mouse from Logitech was scaled down to better fit the hands of children.\nAfter Robert Maxwell took a fall off his yacht, Graftgold\u0026rsquo;s slick platformer \u0026ldquo;Fire \u0026amp; Ice\u0026rdquo; had been without a publisher, but Renegade stepped in and signed it for a May release.\nDeveloper Nirvana were working on two new titles: \u0026ldquo;Disaster Strikes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Edge\u0026rdquo;. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like either were completed.\nFeatures #On this month\u0026rsquo;s cover disk:\n\u0026ldquo;Parasol Stars\u0026rdquo; Graftgold/Ocean This month\u0026rsquo;s winning entries for the \u0026ldquo;Microprose Golf\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Jimmy White\u0026rsquo;s Snooker\u0026rdquo;shots competitions. The developer\u0026rsquo;s profile this month were legend Mike Singleton (\u0026ldquo;Lords of Midnight\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Midwinter\u0026rdquo; etc), and System 3 director Adrian Cale.\nThe One paid a visit to Angel Studios who had just finished up work on the CG FX for \u0026ldquo;The Lawnmower Man\u0026rdquo;. They weren\u0026rsquo;t too happy with the amount of time and effort they sunk into it and were hoping that an experimental internal project called the Solopod would prove successful. The Solopod seems to have been a hydraulic chair for use with VR headsets.\nNot a whole lot of interest in this month\u0026rsquo;s demos section, aside from Razor 1911\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Voyage\u0026rdquo;. Addware were hoping to take Europe by storm with their range of free games offering prizes for gamers who completed them - the first of which was the bizarre \u0026ldquo;Airmania\u0026rdquo;, which looked like a Pi-Man tribute\nNotable Previews # \u0026ldquo;Fire \u0026amp; Ice\u0026rdquo; Graftgold/Renegade \u0026ldquo;Sensible Soccer\u0026rdquo; Sensible Software/Renegade \u0026ldquo;Monkey Island 2: Le Chuck\u0026rsquo;s Revenge\u0026rdquo; Lucasfilm \u0026ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\u0026rdquo; Lucasfilm Notable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Parasol Stars\u0026rdquo; Graftgold/Ocean - 82% \u0026ldquo;Parasol Stars is a good game, there\u0026rsquo;s no doubt about that, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing new, nothing fancy - in short, there are not enough differences between the original game and this one to start making a fuss about.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Space Crusade\u0026rdquo; Gremlin - 89% \u0026ldquo;The big advantage that Space Crusade has over Hero Quest is the use of teams instead of individuals for each player.

Back in the 8 and 16 bit days I would often pour my disdain on these games while proclaiming the superiority of the good old text adventure. I was willing to accept the static images that accompanied games like \u0026ldquo;The Guild of Thieves\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Boggit\u0026rdquo;, but controlling a pixeled character and clicking on things with a limited set of verbs? Leave it out.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until sometime around 2006-ish that I started to dabble in point and clicks, but it was the launch of iOS (especially the iPad) where my love of them was cemented.\nSam Dyer and Bitmap Books have done an exceptional job with their visual compendium books - beautiful design, striking images and some great interviews being their hallmarks.

I actually found a copy of this in a local bookstore around 2000 - completely random.\nThe highly anticipated next instalment in the \u0026ldquo;Bubble Bobble\u0026rdquo; series was heading to home computers. Ocean would be publishing the conversion of \u0026ldquo;Parasol Stars\u0026rdquo;.\nRather than having to break out, Inforgrames\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Alcatraz\u0026rdquo;would see the player having to raid the prison and take it back from terrorists.\nWhile Nintendo had Mario and Sega Sonic, the Amiga had yet to find a platformer mascot of its own. Would the upcoming \u0026ldquo;Titus the Fox\u0026rdquo; from French software house Titus fill that void?\nCore Design was working on not one but two racing games with the Jaguar license. \u0026ldquo;Jaguar XJ220 Sports Racing\u0026rdquo; would take place in 12 different countries, while the second would be based around the Le Mans 24 hour race. Both games were being programmed by Mark Avory, who had apparently also made good progress on a 3D vector racing engine (the two Jag games would be sprite based).\nWere we about to enter the golden period for Sensible Software? They revealed their next three games: \u0026ldquo;Wizkid\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sensible Soccer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cannon Fodder\u0026rdquo;. All three rank amongst the greatest Amiga games ever made.\nThe demise of Mirrorsoft the previous year left a lot of developers without a publisher. Some games were being transferred to Acclaim, but others were in limbo. One such title trying to find a home was Graftgold\u0026rsquo;s rather excellent \u0026ldquo;Fire and Ice\u0026rdquo;.\nSpielberg\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Hook\u0026rdquo; had been a hit at the box office and Ocean hoped that would translate into a big selling game.\nInfogrames struck a deal with Disney to bring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the like to home computers. The first game up for release would star Roger Rabbit in \u0026ldquo;Hare Raising Havoc\u0026rdquo;.\nThe programmer behind \u0026ldquo;Switchblade 2\u0026rdquo; was working on an impressive looking platformer. \u0026ldquo;Zool\u0026rdquo; would see the player take on role of a ninja ant (yes, Gremlin\u0026rsquo;s Ian Richardson described it as a \u0026ldquo;ninja ant\u0026rdquo;) in colourful candy filled levels, and was expected to be on shelves sometime in the summer.\nGrandslam was going to have a crack at the rather crowded golf sim genre with \u0026ldquo;Nick Faldo\u0026rsquo;s Golf\u0026rdquo;.\n200 exhibitors and 40,000 visitors were anticipated for the upcoming Spring Computer Shopper Show at Olympia in May.\nJoystick manufacturer Spectravideo were adding a few more models to its Logic3 range.\nTalking Birds, developer of \u0026ldquo;Football Tactician\u0026rdquo;, promised a year of free update disks of all 440 players in the first division.\nThe next subject to be tackled by sim specialist Maxis would be\u0026hellip; ants. According to Jeff Braun, \u0026ldquo;SimAnt\u0026rdquo; was an \u0026ldquo;apology for \u0026ldquo;SimEarth\u0026rdquo;.\u0026rdquo;\nAdventure game legend Fergus McNeill had turned his attention to spaghetti westerns with \u0026ldquo;Town With No Name\u0026rdquo;, an FMV game for the CDTV.\nHex, a team that had specialised in visuals for music videos, felt that games looked \u0026ldquo;sterile\u0026rdquo; and that their new technique of video sampling would remedy that in \u0026ldquo;Top Banana\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; they certainly succeeded in producing something that could not be described as sterile. This game was examined in one of my favourite Amigos podcast episodes. Extra amusing as the programmer is an old workmate \u0026amp; friend.\nWhen one thinks of player characters, I doubt the role of a tomato comes to mind, but Psygnosis were doing that in the appropriately named\u0026ldquo;Tomato Game\u0026rdquo;.\nRunning a successful airline was the goal of biz sim \u0026ldquo;Air Bucks\u0026rdquo; from Impressions.\nThe classic footie management game \u0026ldquo;Championship Manager\u0026rdquo; was about to debut.\nFeatures #This month Al Lowe (\u0026ldquo;Leisure Suit Larry\u0026rdquo; etc) and Steve Turner (\u0026ldquo;Dragontorc\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Ranarama\u0026rdquo; etc) got the developer profile treatment.\nThe One gave âThe Miracleâ - a piano tutor package complete with keyboard - from Mindscape a whirl.

The One for Amiga '92"},{"content":"Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but what I didn\u0026rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another, longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a single weekend. Work-wise it was a very productive and beneficial time, but it did mean that other things slipped through the cracks.\nDespite that I did manage to make a bit of progress on the game. The items/balls/bubbles/whatever now fall down and pile up correctly. I\u0026rsquo;m still just using characters - I want to get the core game state update functional before worrying about making things look nicer.\nIn order to use characters and get alternating rows offset correctly I\u0026rsquo;m using a series of raster interrupts to modify the horizontal scroll value. In the video below, you can see how it looks before these interrupts start running, and once they are the coloured lines show the amount of raster time they take (which is pretty long due to them occurring on \u0026ldquo;bad lines\u0026rdquo;).\nThe flashing border colours at the top of the screen show the raster time taken for various bits of the game tick routine. The black border is the routine that updates all the cells of what I call the board - each cell in the board is either empty or contains an item. The white shows the time spent re- drawing the board and its cells.\nYes, this is pretty terrible performance wise right now. My philosophy with coding is to do the easiest, quickest thing first and then step back and evaluate. I\u0026rsquo;m not smart enough to plan entire systems out ahead of time - in my experience once you have something doing what you originally thought you wanted, you often realise that it sucks or that there are issues that you hadn\u0026rsquo;t even thought of beforehand. Being able to iterate rapidly on the things that matter is important.\nRandom Problems #Speaking of going with the quickest, easiest implementation first and terrible performance\u0026hellip; This was my initial super basic pass at a random number generator:\nrandom_num_in_range: sta rand_hi !rand_loop: jsr random_num cmp rand_hi bcs !rand_loop- rts random_num: lda $d012 eor $dc04 sbc $dc05 rts rand_hi: .byte 0 The random_num routine was found on this lemon64 thread.\nrandom_num_in_range took a value in the A register and generated a random number between 0 and that value - 1. This allowed me to quickly get to work on the game update routines, but every few frames it would take a very, very long time. The problem, of course, is how it makes sure the result is within the range the caller wanted. In this case it just kept on trying until it generated a number within the desired range - and when that range is small (in this case I was looking for a value between 0 and 5 for the column, and 1 and 4 for the colour), chances are it\u0026rsquo;s gonna have to try a lot of times.\nThe typical approach for this kind of thing is to take the modulus of the random number with the upper value (e.g. for a number between 0 and 5 in C, you would do rand() % 6). I was too lazy to implement a general modulus routine (and I suspect it may be heavier than I would want) so I went with this:\n.macro random_high(high) { jsr random_num .var next = pow(2, ceil(log(high)/log(2))) - 1 and #next !shift_loop: cmp #high bcc !fine+ beq !fine+ sec sbc #high !fine: } Thanks to Kickassembler\u0026rsquo;s very nice language features, I calculate the power of 2 value that\u0026rsquo;s either equal to the passed in parameter or the next highest. Then I can subtract 1 to get a bitmask (e.g if the value passed in was 8, then the bitmask would be 7, i.e. %00000111), use the logical and, and if that result happens to be out of range then I just subtract the high value. Once again that\u0026rsquo;ll give me a number between 0 and high- 1.\nThe problem with this is that if you want, say, a number between 0 and 5, then that\u0026rsquo;s a fraction of the possible numbers returned by the random_num routine (which is a byte, so 0-255). So the distribution of numbers in the desired range is highly dependent on just how good your random number generator is.\nThis video shows the result of using the original, super cheap \u0026amp; basic routine.\nNot ideal, eh?

C\u0026VG '90"},{"content":" Here is the first screenshot of a new game I\u0026rsquo;m working on - awesome eh? Wait, don\u0026rsquo;t walk away! It\u0026rsquo;ll get better, I promise!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various points I\u0026rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made it through to the end and even that took way too long. The reasons for the slow/non-existent progress have typically revolved around being swamped with work, being overly ambitious and getting distracted by new shiny things.\nWill this one be any different? I would like to think so. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to start this right as my work is entering the most intense, crazy phase yet\u0026hellip; so perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m being a tad optimistic. But as I\u0026rsquo;ve really gotten back into the Amiga and C64 scenes over the past year or so, they\u0026rsquo;ve become a genuinely positive respite from the craziness of my job. Starting with a C64 game also means a lot of constraints - and constraints in game dev can be a very good thing! As far as the game itself goes, it\u0026rsquo;s hardly original - I will admit it\u0026rsquo;s probably not entirely clear from the screenshot, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a match 3-y/tetris-y/puzzle bubble-y kind of a game. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that will mean I can keep things reasonably simple and focussed.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, they say.\nWhile I did have a number of fond years with my C64 back in the day, I never really did a whole lot of coding on it. I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure why - I guess playing games consumed most of my time. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until I had my Amiga and met a Swedish bloke at university (as you do) that I really started getting into assembler.. and the rest, I guess, is history.\nSo why not do an Amiga game? That\u0026rsquo;s a good question. My 68k is definitely rusty (though it is amusing how quickly one starts to recall the hardware registers), and the more limited nature of the C64 is appealing - plus it\u0026rsquo;s a chance to learn something new. One other factor is that the 64 scene is really flourishing at the moment - a lot of people creating awesome projects. Things are a bit different with the Amiga scene - I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why exactly, but I figure give it a couple of years. Oh, something that has really struck me about 6502/6510: holy crap the 68k was such a huge leap! I had no idea just how good we had it.\nMy intention is to post an update monthly\u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that one goes.\npostimage c64bites.png\nAround the time I started contemplating this project, I discovered Michal Taszycki\u0026rsquo;s excellent video series, 64bites. Each video lasts only around 5-7 minutes, but they go at quite a pace, cover some pretty hardcore topics and if you factor in the exercises (which I highly recommend doing) then you\u0026rsquo;re looking at 30-60 mins a pop. I\u0026rsquo;m not the sharpest tool in the box, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite possible most people will breeze through them a lot quicker.\nOld school game dev Derek Morris recently published a book on writing games for the C64 - I only bought it yesterday, so haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to get stuck in yet but it looks like an excellent introduction.\nHere are a few more useful sites if you\u0026rsquo;re curious about giving it a shot yourself:\n6502.org has a tonne of great info, for example this tutorial on the compare instructions (is it just me who gets these wrong at the first attempt nearly every time?!). The C64 wiki is an excellent reference, e.g. the C64 character sets and colours. This site has a load of old C64 books. If you\u0026rsquo;re wondering if someone else has already tackled a specific problem, check out Codebase 64 which has a bunch of source code (incl sprite multiplexers), tutorials and more. A good rundown of key algorithms for the 6502. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a quick intro to 6502 assembler, check Assembly in One Step out.

I\u0026rsquo;ve sunk quite a lot of hours into attempting to diagnose the faults and finding replacement bits online, with mixed success. Given that it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that I was eagerly awaiting the release of the C64 Reloaded mk2.\nIn order to get started with one of these boards, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to source a few items:\nCPU 6510 or 8500 two CIA 6526(A) or 8521 chips VIC 6567, 6569, 8565 or 8562 one or two SIDs - 6581 and/or 8580, two can be used at the same time for dual SID audio! 12V DC poer supply (don\u0026rsquo;t forget this! I managed to get all the chips required, went to set it up and realised I forgot the most easily found item\u0026hellip;) The build quality is very good, and setup was a doddle. The ZIF chip connectors mean it\u0026rsquo;s simple to insert and remove chips - no more nervewracking levering! The board even auto-detects what\u0026rsquo;s installed which means no need for jumpers.\nOne thing I have yet to do is try connecting to the Remote Menu. We only have Macs at home, and the Reloaded mk2 wiki contains some dire warnings about using the USB driver on OSX.\nCaution: The Prolific driver for macOS is really crappy. It keeps your system from shutting down, crashes if you insert/remove the USB connector a second time, and since there is no automatic de-installer, it is hard to remove from the system. You have been warned: We do not recommend to use this driver.\nI need to try setting up a Linux VM to see if I can connect via that.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;ve been really impressed. Going forward this will be my C64 workhorse, and I look forward to getting into the more advanced options. The one thing that is a bit annoying is that when placed inside a breadbin case, the power switch is too close to the bottom edge which makes powering on/off and resetting tricky - I\u0026rsquo;m sure I can figure out a way to improve this though.\nUpdate #Fearing the consequences of installing the USB drivers on my Mac, I setup an Ubuntu VM and that worked a charm. I followed the wiki\u0026rsquo;s advice and used minicom. Once the USB is connected and you power on the C64 you get a little welcome message (I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you can connect it at any time). The menu allows you to configure a number of things, including the behaviour of short \u0026amp; long holds of the \u0026ldquo;reset\u0026rdquo; button (power button down is off, up is on, and there\u0026rsquo;s a further debounced up position which by default resets the machine), and enabling dual SID mode. You can even upload custom kernal and character ROMs.\nI changed the reset button to switch between my two SID chips and discovered with some delight that these can be switched at runtime without interferring with whatever is running. This is very very cool as it means I can go back and forth between the 6581 and 8580 chips and hear their different characteristics.\nDetails of the chips installed.\nThe various SID config options.\n","date":"11 January 2018","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2018/1/9/c64-reloaded-mk2-board/","section":"","summary":"","title":"C64 Reloaded mk2 Board"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/hardware/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hardware"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/categories/recent-pickups/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Recent Pickups"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/reloaded/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reloaded"},{"content":" This month\u0026rsquo;s mag included:\nA rather depressing Editorial which opened with \u0026ldquo;Boom-time for the computer games world is over, at least for the next few years.\u0026rdquo; The Japanese consoles were wiping the floor with computers - the 8bits were barely hanging on, the ST not far behind them.

While that didn\u0026rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th.\nWith Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to release a couple of compilations. Both would include\u0026ldquo;Uridium\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cybernoid II\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;Sanxion\u0026rdquo; being exclusive to the C64 and \u0026ldquo;Hydrofool\u0026rdquo; to the Spectrum.\nMastertronic made a bold move with the first 16bit budget range with titles costing a mere Â£4.99.\nA controller that would \u0026ldquo;enable the player to almost forget it is there and appear to play his favourite arcade games by thought alone\u0026rdquo; was promised by Spectravideo with The Flight Controller.

He was a prolific musician who turned out some incredible tunes. Seeing \u0026ldquo;Commando\u0026rdquo; at my mate\u0026rsquo;s place one afternoon after school helped convince me I needed a C64. I remember going back to his house, tape recorder in hand, to record the music to listen to on repeat (especially that lovely game over tune). It sounds kind of crazy now, but I bought games purely because they featured his music - and keep in mind, games weren\u0026rsquo;t cheap here in NZ. I was most certainly not alone in doing this.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s fantastic to see this Kickstarter celebrating the man\u0026rsquo;s career.

The \u0026ldquo;Action Pack\u0026rdquo; would consist of a Spectrum +2 (Â£149) or +3 (Â£199), a Magnum light gun and 6 games.\nUS Gold\u0026rsquo;s KIXX label had some classic C64 games lined up for Â£2.99 cassette, Â£4.99 disk including: \u0026ldquo;Summer Games\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;World Games\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Pit Stop II\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Cybernoid\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Mission Elevator\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gauntlet\u0026rdquo;/ \u0026ldquo;Gauntlet II\u0026rdquo;.

Others were expected to follow suit, though that did seem somewhat unlikely as thatâs a steep drop down from Â£9.95. Gary Penn pondered how lower prices might affect the quality of games - lower budgets for development? less licensed tie-ins? (The latter was considered a good thing)\nCiaran Brennan was promoted to Assistant Editor, and Gary Liddon was due to make his return next month.\nMastertronic had spun off a subsidiary called Arcadia which would focus on arcade coin-ops. They had licensed boards based on the Amiga hardware from Commodore, with extra RAM (1.5mb) and games supplied on ROMS which could hold up to 6.5mb of data. The first two games were to be \u0026ldquo;Road Wars\u0026rdquo; and an enhanced version of \u0026ldquo;Boulderdash\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Enterprise\u0026rdquo; from Melbourne House was space trading game sporting vector graphics and the ability to interact with alien computer systems via text (unreleased on C64?).\nA sequel to \u0026ldquo;Druid\u0026rdquo;was on its way.\nIt looked to be a busy few months for Piranha, who had eight releases in development which included\u0026ldquo;Trap Door II\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Flunky\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Yogi Bear\u0026rdquo;.\nSimon Nicol\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mega Apocalypse\u0026rdquo; had been two years in the making and was finally done.

On a lighter note, they were also going to release \u0026ldquo;Ninja Hamster\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Traxxion\u0026rdquo;.\nThere was a small over exposed screenshot of Ocean\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;oriental mega-game\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Tai-Pan\u0026rdquo;.\nFeatures #This month\u0026rsquo;s instalment of Andrew Braybrook\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Morpheus\u0026rdquo; developer diary saw him tackling the pause menu (which was complicated by his new sprite multiplexor), ship upgrades and tuning the ship controls and weapons.

Graham Axtenâs platformer, which starred a rather charming bear, was looking great and was eagerly anticipated.\nThe game draws heavily from Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy, with a graphics style reminiscent of Creatures. The influence of Matthew Smithâs classic games is clear right from the start, where instead of housekeeper Maria turning Willy away to go tidy the house after a massive party, itâs Bearâs wife wanting enough apples to get the family through the winter.\nThere are 350 apples to collect, dotted around over 60 screens. The game world is divided into 6 areas, each with its own graphical style and enemies:\nHome Forest Cloudy Rocky Jungle Mine In between the Forest/Cloudy/Rocky/Jungle/Mine areas are checkpoint screens which award a continue on the first visit. These also allow the player to choose the order they tackle areas.\nThe controls are straightforward, with basic movement and jumping. The jumping feels good - the fact that the player retains some control during jumps makes it possible to get out of some hairy situations.\nThis is one of those games where you need to keep your cool and not get impatient - often I would lose one life, then attempt to rush through the room again and lose a couple more in the process. I enjoyed several hours playing it, but in the end I relied on a cheat code that granted infinite continues in order to complete it (there are several cheats listed in Freeze64 issue 7). While that is a bit of a cop out, it was still a good challenge and was ultimately satisfying. The mine area gives the player infinite continues by default, and trust me: you\u0026rsquo;ll need them.\nThere are a few extras on the disk which are rather good:\nBonkey Kong (4k \u0026amp; super versions\u0026hellip; a super simple game but actually a lot of fun) Bear 2016 (an almost identical version, but lacks some of the screens and has 326 apples to collect) Bear 1st Preview (just one screen, no enemies or apples, but shows off the platforms \u0026amp; player movement) Bear 2nd Preview (multiple screens with enemies and apples to collect) Attack of the Mutant Cabbages Music Demo Bonkey Kong Music Demo Super Bonkey Kong Music Demo One really cool thing is that Graham posted a developer diary as the game started to come together:\nPart one Part two Part three Part four Part five \u0026ldquo;Bear Essentials\u0026rdquo; can be purchased from Pondsoft - as of writing the disc version was available, with the cassette coming soon. Recently Protovisionalso started distributing the game.\nFor further reading, Graham was interviewed in Freeze64 issue 4 and Reset 9.5.\nOverall, I think this is the best recent C64 game I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far. There are times when the jumps required are complete bastards, and it can be frustrating, but I never felt like the game was unfair. The graphics are very good, with quite a bit of variety throughout the areas, and the sound \u0026amp; music are top notch. Even if you need to use a cheat, stick with it until you reach the Mine area\u0026hellip;\nVerdict\nâ¤ï¸\n","date":"14 July 2017","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2017/7/14/review-the-bear-essentials-c64-by-pondsoft/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Review: The Bear Essentials (C64) by Pondsoft"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/categories/reviews/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Reviews"},{"content":" Well, hot on the heels of yesterdays Ultimate-64 announcement comes the news that Individual Computers are about to start production of the C64 Reloaded Mk2.

For the European leg we jaunted about in a campervan, staying at campsites (and occasionally on roadsides) along the way. My memories of that time are sadly vague - my main recollection is the ridiculously rough toilet paper that one had to endure in the bathrooms. Iâm talking really rough. Like coarse sandpaper. I forget what town it was, but I actually kept a piece of it in my jacket pocket to remind me of the horrors, and it was still intact when we got home.\nThe setting for this game is based on an actual German campsite the creator(s) spent time at during their formative years, and there is a nice nostalgic feel to it all. Along with the disk (in a rather nicely decorated sleeve), the package includes a campsite newsletter, a beer mat, a lump of charcoal wrapped in foil, a peppermint teabag and, yes, a piece of camp toilet paper (though an acceptably soft piece - I guess the world has progressed\u0026hellip; or maybe we were staying at the wrong campsites). Unsurprisingly, one should read through the newsletter as it does contain some important clues.\nThe adventure begins with the player waking up in a dark hut with a terrible headache, and it soon becomes apparent that your friends and the camp staff have all disappeared. Looks like itâs going to fall on you to figure out what happened to them.\nDeveloped by TUGCS (The United German Commodore Service) using the âD42 Adventure Systemâ for FORUM64âs 2015 Adventure competition, the game was picked up for a proper release by Protovision. Rather than the player entering text commands, there are a small number of actions, some of which take one or two objects to act on. This certainly reduces the frustration of trying to guess specific words on top of tackling the puzzle at hand, but there are some weird inconsistencies (e.g. in one puzzle it was surely possible to both move or open a particular object, but only one verb was accepted).\nEach location is accompanied by a picture, the quality of which varies a bit, but overall theyâre good. Adding to the atmosphere is the sound - both FX and some decent tunes. I got the impression these are significant, but I must admit I could never quite figure out in what way.\nOne of several amusing Bush related jokes.\nI found the humour to be rather fun. I donât mean this in a bad way, but it is very German, and often reminded me of amusing things my German friends say. I suspect there are number of in jokes that completely passed me by - it was always hard to tell if I was missing something or whether the translation didnât quite work. There are a tonne of 80s references, most of which Iâm pleased to say I got.\nThe game is unforgiving, and makes no bones about it. In fact, soon after you start it nudges you to perform an action and then gleefully points out you shouldâve saved before hand. Thatâs not the last time you can do something which seems innocuous, yet will eventually prevent the game from being completed.\nDue to the graphics and sound, moving between locations always incurs a disk load, and with the game split between two disk sides this can be a bit tedious. I first fired it up on one of my real C64s, but soon switched to an emulator, bumping up the CPU speed during loads.\nIâve played a fair number of adventure games in my time (though I donât consider myself an expert), and there were a small number of - in my opinion - completely baffling puzzles. I managed to get quite someway into the game before throwing up my hands and searching the internet for hints. The funny thing is that even having discovered a walkthrough, the fact that it was in German combined with said puzzles not making much sense, there was still plenty of figuring out to be done.\nPerhaps the biggest annoyance is that the exits of some locations donât make any geographic sense - e.g. you go north, then continue north, and end up back where you started.\nGripes aside, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here. Given that this was a compo entry, I was impressed as to the number of locations and general quality of puzzles.\nI love the fact that in this day and age a C64 adventure was created and sold in a package with Infocom-style âfeeliesââ¦ Itâs even more impressive considering that this is a translation from the German original.\nVerdict\nð\n\u0026ldquo;The Camp\u0026rdquo; can be purchased direct from Protovision.\n","date":"22 June 2017","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2017/6/22/review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Review: \"The Camp\" (C64) by Protovision"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/the-camp/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Camp"},{"content":" News #Firebird closed a deal with Activision/Electric Dreams which would see the budget publisher re-releasing a slew of older titles from the US for Â£1.99 each.\nNo changes at Zzap! this month, though Julian Rignall got engaged to Glenys Powell, the âever-effervescentâ Editorial Assistant.\nZzap! launched in Italy.

I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of those old SID tunes, and Matt did a brilliant job of updating them while keeping that distinct sound that made them so special\u0026hellip; so I have high hopes for volume 2!\nSNES/Super Famicom: a visual compendium #I\u0026rsquo;ve backed all of Sam\u0026rsquo;s books so far and they\u0026rsquo;ve yet to disappoint. Beautifully presented, with a good helping of interesting stories and tidbits. They\u0026rsquo;ve certainly prodded me to go check out some of the classic games which passed me by at the time, as well as those that I\u0026rsquo;d long forgotten about.\nClosed, but worth following: #Commodore: The Inside Story #If you listen to retro gaming podcasts, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you would\u0026rsquo;ve heard David Pleasance pop up in an interview. He promises a bit of a no holds barred tell all about the rise and fall of Commodore. I doubt there is anyone who would\u0026rsquo;ve had a better insight into just what the hell was going on, so this book should be very interesting.\nThe Commodore Story - Changing the world 8-bits at a time #This looks like it should have potential. I was a little disappointed with the recent \u0026ldquo;Viva Amiga\u0026rdquo; doco (it was fine, but it was too light for my liking), so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping for something more from this one.\nThaumistry: In Charm\u0026rsquo;s Way.

They\u0026rsquo;re looking to raise $250,000, which is certainly a hefty amount, but as of writing they\u0026rsquo;re almost a quarter of the way there and the positive buzz in the retro community in the lead up to this suggests they won\u0026rsquo;t have too much trouble crossing the line (fingers crossed!).\n","date":"23 April 2017","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2017/4/23/zx-spectrum-next-kickstarter-launched/","section":"","summary":"","title":"ZX Spectrum Next Kickstarter Launched!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/zxspectrum/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ZXSpectrum"},{"content":" News #Gary Penn wrote a long editorial on a matter that had been on a lot of peopleâs minds: had quality and innovation taken a dive as software houses relied more and more on coin-op, TV and film licenses? The market seemed to be full of these unimaginative and often shoddy tie ins which, aside from the attached IP, only had good presentation going for them. Developers were feeling the pinch as well: publishers would âguarantee 100,000â copies sold, giving them an excuse to lower royalties. Lump sums also went out the window as all the money had been blown on the license. The piece ended with: âUnfortunately, software houses will continue to release repackaged versions of the same old thing if that is what the customers want.

The former issue was hardly the magazineâs fault as publisherâs were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers.\nElectric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64.

Well, thatâs not entirely true as \u0026ldquo;The Bardâs Tale\u0026rdquo; picked up a very respectable Sizzler, though apparently it didnât count as it was âa role playing gameâ. It seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before Christmas to polish up their hopeful hits. On the bright side, there was a lot to look forward to next monthâ¦\nNot one but two new games from Andrew Braybrook?! Well, not quite, but there was still good cause to be excited.

Not bad at Â£8.95.\nGremlinâs followup to \u0026ldquo;Way of the Tigerâ, \u0026ldquo;Avengerâ, was making its way to the C64.

It would feature all seven test countries, an all time XI, a world XI and digitised speech.

Interestingly the former was developed by adventure game specialists Level 9.

After a string of critically acclaimed games (and the occasional stinker), rumours had started to do the rounds earlier in the year that the company was closing up. As it turned out, three of the four co-founders had split, but Ally Noble remained to steady the ship and the Liverpudlian developer was still going strong. John Gibson had become an independent contractor for Ocean, Steve Cain co-founded Canvas, with Graham Everitt and Karen Davies frequently contracting for them.\nEleven of the C64âs finest coders were asked what they would want to have on them if they were ever stranded on a desert island. Jeff Minterâs luxury item, perhaps unsurprisingly, was: âA Llama, definitely a Llama.

I figured Iâd revisit the Amiga version as the screen redraw is unsurprisingly somewhat snappier. My first attempts were complete failures, and I had to resort to reading the instructions (shock horror).\nThe game is still an interesting and enjoyable challenge. The way the procedurally generated levels and progression works means that you never quite know how difficult a level will be (aside from the initial one). There are 10000 landscapes in total with the player starting on â0000â, and when a level is completed the player jumps forward by a number determined by how many resources were left. The difficulty varies tremendously, though each level is\nin theory - completable. I say in theory as on one session I hit landscape 0023 pretty quickly, and Iâm convinced that one is impossible (I couldnât find a way to even make the first teleport!). The sense of dread as the Sentinel rotates is still palpable.\nZzap!64 took the rather unusual stance of not rating it, instead just awarding it a Gold Medal. I think that was fair enough. Itâd be nice to see this re- done on a modern machine with a solid framerate.\nâThe Trapdoorâ, Don Priestly/Pirahna, 1986\nReviewed in Zzap!64 December 1986.\nBefore I had my C64 I played this on my Spectrum. The graphics were very impressive - big, bold characters, and it did a great job of hiding the Speccyâs colour clash.\nThe C64 version is good. I didnât expect to spend much time on it, but an hour quickly passed. Itâs has a lot of character and humour. The one thing that really lets it down is the plummeting framerate whenever thereâs a few things going on on screenâ¦ which results in slow response times and frustration. Makes me wonder if the Spectrum version suffered from that too.\nI may have to give this a proper play under emulation where I can crank up the CPU.\nZzap!64 awarded it 89%.\nâThe Sacred Armour of Antiriadâ, Palace Software, 1986\nReviewed Zzap!64 December 1986.\nThis was one of the most impressive looking games on the C64 at the time. Coming from the Speccy, it blew me away.\nAs with many games, I never got very far back then. I decided I would rectify that with the use of trainers (naturally). The controls are frustrating.. stand and push fire to throw a rock, stand and push up to jump, but move left and right and hit fire to run and jump etcâ¦ what?! When you get the armour and are flying around, the pinball-esque collisions are infuriating.\nFor a game that was a direct result of Dan Maloneâs fantastic art, I had naively expected some kind of cinematic ending when the game is completed. Hah! A simple âyou winâ kind of message and then back to the title screen. Ugh.\nNot sure it deserved the 93% Sizzler.\nâBMX Simulatorâ, Codemasters, 1986\nReviewed Zzap!64 December 1986.\nI think I may have moved onto the Amiga by the time this came around, and so I had never tried the C64 version.\nI found it completely frustrating. The game is utterly punishing of pixel mistakes and itâs all too easy to end up in situations where you instantly fall off your bike as soon as you respawn. I fired up the Amiga version as thatâs the one I remember playing, and that seemed to control betterâ¦ but it still wasnât great.\nZzap!64 rated it 83% and declared it worth a look if âyouâre too old for the real thingââ¦ I think Iâm too old for this unforgiving gameplay.\nâTrailblazerâ, Shaun Southern/Gremlin Graphics, 1986\nReviewed ZZzap!64 December 1986.\nThis is a game that I often loaded up on my 64 back in the day, but I donât think I was ever really any good at it - something that hasnât changed in the intervening years. A fiendishly difficult game requiring super quick reactions, but somewhat enjoyable.\nIâm sure the music was betterâ¦ and the scrolling message on the main title screen was a lot longer. Iâm obviously confusing it with another game, but what one??\nIt received a 93% Sizzler.\nâBoulderdash Construction Kitâ, Databyte/First Star, 1986\nI was sure I would end up spending most of my ârevisitingâ time playing this one. Boulderdash is such a classic, and this was considered the ultimate version.\nButâ¦ to my shame I never actually managed to play a single level. The main menu (on the game program, not the construction kit) was impenetrable. Iâm still baffled as to how one actually starts a game. Seriously.\nA common theme Iâm discovering is how little patience I have for this stuff, so Iâll just take Zzap!âs word for it and maybe Iâll try again sometime.\nThe 97% Gold Medal ranks it as one of the most highly rated C64 games ever .\nâOperation Wolfâ, Ocean, 1988\nReviewed in C\u0026amp;VG December 1988\nNote: The ST and Spectrum versions were reviewed, but I played it on the Amiga. Iâm pretty sure it was a straight ST port (ugh).\nI had somewhat fond memories of playing this on the Amiga - I seem to recall thinking it was an impressive arcade conversionâ¦ Iâm not quite sure why as the scrolling is not smooth, neither are the animations. The sound is pretty average. The mouse should work well for aiming, but the cross hair seemed weirdly offset from where I was firing - not by a large amount, but enough to cause many frustrating moments, like when daggers are flying towards you. Iâm doubtful I successfully shot a single one. Worst of all is that it is ridiculously hard. During a dozen or so attempts I completely failed to get past the first level. I suspect that is largely due to me losing skill and patience over the years, but stillâ¦\n91% C\u0026amp;VG? noâ¦ a decidedly average ST port. Disappointing.\nâEmilyn Hughes International Soccerâ, Audiogenic, 1988\nReviewed in C\u0026amp;VG December 1988, C64.\nIâve played many footie games over the years, but the UI of this game totally stumped me. I completely failed to even start a game which wasnât computer vs computer. I have no idea how that is done. It looked like a relatively deep game, with management being a huge part of it.\nC\u0026amp;VG scored it 94%, saying it was âan amazing productâ. Who knows.\nâInternational Karate+\u0026quot; Archer Maclean/System 3, 1988\nReviewed C\u0026amp;VG December 1988.\nNote: The review was of the ST version, but the Amiga one is similar enough.\nI actually bought this back in the day (still have it!) and played the hell out of it. IK on the C64 was one of my fave games of that period, and IK+ improved on it considerably. It still holds up well. Unsurprisingly, the game now feels rather simplistic as far as fighting games go, but I love that. I love the fact that it is all controlled with a standard 8 direction, 1 button joystick. My only minor niggle is that it could do with some faster/smoother character animation.\nC\u0026amp;VG awarded it 93%, and for once I would agree with that.\n","date":"31 December 2016","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2016/12/31/december-games-revisited/","section":"","summary":"","title":"December Games Revisited"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/categories/games-revisited/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Games Revisited"},{"content":" News #More changes were afoot, with Strategy Front writer Sean Masterson moving on and the start of a make over that would take effect during the next few months.\nLast month Zzap! teased readers by asking them to check out a screenshot of the hotly anticipated arcade conversion of \u0026ldquo;Gauntlet\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; and then failed to print it.

Melbourne House were also beavering away on a \u0026ldquo;Judge Dredd\u0026rdquo; game.\nIan Martin, programmer behind \u0026ldquo;ACE\u0026rdquo;, had taken inspiration from the Endor speederbike scenes in \u0026ldquo;Return of the Jedi\u0026rdquo; for his next title \u0026ldquo;Sky Runner\u0026rdquo;.\nNexus had two new games in the works: \u0026ldquo;Assault Machine\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;PSI Warrior II\u0026rdquo; (unreleased).\nEpyx\u0026rsquo;s new action simulation would see the player take command of a \u0026ldquo;Destroyer\u0026rdquo; in the South Pacific during WWII.\nAriolasoft hoped to have several titles out in time for Christmas: \u0026ldquo;Zarjaz\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;They Stole a Million\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Blitzkrieg\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Camelot\u0026rdquo;.

Their arcade truck racer \u0026ldquo;Supertrux\u0026rdquo; was narrowly going to miss the holiday season and was due early January.\nA new arcade attraction in Tokyo saw sit down Outrun cabinets repurposed in a game in which drivers would steer real remote controlled cars around a complicated track. Video from cameras mounted on the bonnet was streamed to the screens.\n\u0026ldquo;BAAL\u0026rdquo; was the next 16bit game due out from Psygnosis. Screenshots certainly looked nice, but would it play any better than their previous offerings?\nGremlin\u0026rsquo;s foray into the recently crowded post-apocalyptic-vehicle-combat genre was \u0026ldquo;Motorway Madness\u0026rdquo; (maybe it was released as \u0026ldquo;Motor Massacre\u0026rdquo; ?).\nAlternative Software got the game rights to \u0026ldquo;Postman Pat\u0026rdquo; and hoped to have it on the shelves by Christmas.\nA screenshot appeared of \u0026ldquo;Let Sleeping Gods Lie\u0026rdquo; from Elektra appeared, with C\u0026amp;VG declaring \u0026ldquo;the whole thing looks most bizarre.\u0026rdquo; (it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bizarre!)\nGerman software house Axxion was hoping to break into the UK market with a series of games for the Amiga and ST. The first title, \u0026ldquo;Way of the Little Dragon\u0026rdquo;, was due in time for Christmas with \u0026ldquo;Crystal Hammer\u0026rdquo; (Arkanoid clone - released as \u0026ldquo;Growth\u0026rdquo; ?) and \u0026ldquo;Powerstyx\u0026rdquo; (Qix clone) following soon after.

The latter would re- appear as [\u0026ldquo;Denaris\u0026rdquo;][3049], but there would be no return for the sisters\u0026hellip;\nSony\u0026rsquo;s Video Walkman was due out in the UK in the new year. It would take 8mm video cassettes, sport a 3\u0026quot; LCD screen and last up to three hours on one charge. There was no official price mentioned, but it would likely set you back about the same as a regular VCR.\nNo big name blockbuster movie licenses for Coktel Vision this summer as they were releasing a game based on softcore adult flick [\u0026ldquo;Emmanuelle\u0026rdquo;][3050]. Details were vague\u0026hellip;\nNovagen were about to release their third 16bit game, a scrolling shooter called [\u0026ldquo;Hellbent\u0026rdquo;][3051]. This time the programming was being handled by newcomer Donovan Prince (an \u0026ldquo;unlikely name\u0026rdquo; according to C\u0026amp;VG), rather than Paul Woakes.\n\u0026ldquo;Sticky Decision\u0026rdquo; was a new shoot \u0026rsquo;em up from Gremlin. Meanwhile, they were getting in on the footie market with a game based on [\u0026ldquo;Roy of the Rovers\u0026rdquo;][3052].\nMagnetic Scrolls were signed up to produce a series of mini-adventure games for Tony Rainbird\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Official Secrets\u0026rdquo; discount mail order and adventure club. As far as I know, only one materialised: [\u0026ldquo;Myth\u0026rdquo;][3053]. I think I may have all of the issues of the club magazine, \u0026ldquo;Confidential\u0026rdquo;.\nThere was a much larger than usual Arcade Action section.\nJohn Minson took a break from ranting to go interview Gerry Anderson about Thunderbirds, Supermarionation and how depressing Hollywood could be. A pilot for \u0026ldquo;Space Police\u0026rdquo; was about to be released and Anderson revealed he was in talks for a new Thunderbirds movie.\nFeatures #C\u0026amp;VG attended the 3rd annual Festival de la Micro in Paris, which didn\u0026rsquo;t sound terribly interesting.\nThe movies reviewed this month were: \u0026ldquo;Colors\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Stand and Deliver\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Nico\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Seventh Sign\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Hidden\u0026rdquo;, [\u0026ldquo;Taffin\u0026rdquo;][3054], \u0026ldquo;Bird\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Imagine: John Lennon\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Switching Channels\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Kansas\u0026rdquo;.\nA round up of the current offering of footie games. Topping the strategy rankings was [\u0026ldquo;Tracksuit Manager\u0026rdquo;][3055] from Goliath Games, while Sega\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Sega Soccer\u0026rdquo; narrowly pipped Sensible\u0026rsquo;s [\u0026ldquo;Microprose Soccer\u0026rdquo;][3056] for best arcade. While [\u0026ldquo;Emilyn Huges International Soccer\u0026rdquo;][3057] was reviewed very favourably in this issue, it missed the deadline for the article.\nKeith Campbell pondered: are adventure games dead? Level 9 was going to start producing fantasy role playing games with graphics along the lines of Sierra games, Magnetic Scrolls were elusive about their plans, while Infocom announced all new adventures would feature graphics.\nNotable Reviews # [\u0026ldquo;Operation Wolf\u0026rdquo;][3058] Ocean - ST 91% Spectrum 91% C64 92% C\u0026amp;VG Hit \u0026ldquo;So what is our advice should you only be buying one coin-op conversion this Christmas?

C\u0026VG '88"},{"content":"I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday.\nAt any rate\u0026hellip; Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in November many years ago to rave reviews.\nI wanted to include \u0026ldquo;Speedball\u0026rdquo; (reviewed in C\u0026amp;VG \u0026lsquo;88, 84%) as I played that a lot when it came out, but sadly I\u0026rsquo;d forgotten about the compatibility issues with the Amiga 1200 and older titles - nothing I tried got it to boot. Ah well.\nWorld Games, Epyx, 1986\nReviewed in Zzap!64 November 1986.\nOut of all the games this month, I played this one the most back in the day. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a disk drive for my C64 which meant multi-load games like this were rather painful. On the plus side, it did mean that once I\u0026rsquo;d loaded an event I sure as hell stuck with it. The funny thing is that upon booting this up on Sunday I found all that muscle memory kicking in and was able to get playing without consulting any instructions. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s not entirely true. Slalom Skiing had me baffled, then my confusion grew for Log Rolling, and I got no where with the Caber Toss. Thankfully looking up instructions helped with the latter, but screw the skiing and log rolling. Five out of eight isn\u0026rsquo;t bad.\nZzap!64 scored it an incredible 98%, the highest score I recall seeing them dish out. Looking back I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure I agree with that, though I do have fond memories of playing the Cliff Diving for many hours. Most of the events are still enjoyable and the presentation with all it\u0026rsquo;s nice - often humourous - little touches is still great.\nTass Times in Tone Town, Activision, 1986\nReviewed in Zzap!64 November 1986.\nI\u0026rsquo;d never actually played this one before (I imagine it was disk only), but I remember seeing glowing reviews of it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know quite what I was thinking when I decided I\u0026rsquo;d try to cram it into those precious few hours on Sunday. Things started off okay and it seemed like a quirky fun adventure\u0026hellip; and then I died and had to restart\u0026hellip; that happened a number of times. My frustration was rising as I felt the time slipping away, and I was getting no where. I caved and looked up a walkthrough. \u0026ldquo;Aha! now I can get past that bit and really get into it\u0026rdquo;, I thought. And a few minutes later I was dead again.\nThis is not a game to pick up and play for an hour or two, which is a shame as Zzap!64 game it an impressive 95%. In fact the White Wizard opened his review by saying:\n\u0026ldquo;Every once in a while, there is an adventure so inspired, so beautifully crafted and so ingeniously devised that it leaves its mark on everything that follows.\u0026rdquo;\nBlimey.\nI really should go back to it again sometime\u0026hellip;\nMicroprose Soccer, Sensible Software/Microprose, 1988\nReviewed in C\u0026amp;VG November 1988.\nSomehow this passed me by when it first came out on the C64. I guess by then I had already moved on to the Amiga, and my poor C64 was left to gather dust. I do remember playing the Amiga version at some point, but it never really stuck\u0026hellip; which is interesting because \u0026ldquo;Sensible World of Soccer\u0026rdquo; is my fave game of all time.\nThe first thing that struck me upon loading it up was how un-Sensible it all looked\u0026hellip; as in, it all looked way too sensible (small \u0026rsquo;s\u0026rsquo;). And was that music really by Martin Galway?!\nPutting my initial impressions behind me I started to play. My first couple of games were a confusing mess. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to go backwards from Sensi Soccer. I was ready to put it down and move on, but figured I\u0026rsquo;d play a couple more times as I was waiting for a game to boot on my Amiga. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I did, because I finally started to get the hang of it. It\u0026rsquo;s still a pale shadow of SWOS, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good game in there.\nC\u0026amp;VG awarded it 95% and Game of the Month, saying that it was \u0026ldquo;undoubtedly the best football game ever produced\u0026rdquo;. Which, I can imagine at that point, was an accurate statement, but I\u0026rsquo;ll stick with SWOS thankyouverymuch.\n","date":"30 November 2016","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2016/11/30/november-games-revisited/","section":"","summary":"","title":"November Games Revisited"},{"content":" News #Editor Gary Penn trumpeted the success of Zzap!, saying that it had become the \u0026ldquo;biggest selling Commodore magazine in the civilised World.\u0026rdquo; The healthy sales meant more advertisers, which meant more content - this month the mag hit 148 pages.\nA Commodore show took place in Manchester.

Maltese based trade body Software Distribution Enterprises was attempting to pressure the government into taking some action.\nNewly created label Pirahna revealed their first C64 title: \u0026ldquo;Strike Force Cobra\u0026rdquo;.

Film tie ins \u0026ldquo;Aliens\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Big Trouble in Little China\u0026rdquo;, and sequel to the Atari clasic, \u0026ldquo;Star Raiders II\u0026rdquo;.

Their next release was to be an adaptation of Terry Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Colour of Magic\u0026rdquo;.\nGary Penn chatted with John Twiddy about his recent C64 conversion of \u0026ldquo;Tau Ceti\u0026rdquo; (and very good it was, too), what was in the pipeline, and what he\u0026rsquo;d really like to work on.\nThis month\u0026rsquo;s Zzapback! featured:\n\u0026ldquo;The Little Computer People Discovery Kit\u0026rdquo; Activision \u0026ldquo;Paradroid\u0026rdquo; Hewson \u0026ldquo;Winter Games\u0026rdquo; Epyx/US Gold \u0026ldquo;Wizardâs Lair\u0026rdquo; Bubble Bus There were a bunch of pics from the PCW show.\nNewsfield rented out the Camden Palace to launch \u0026ldquo;L.M.\u0026rdquo;, their new mag targeting 18-30 year old men. While the mag was well received, it only lasted a mere four issues.\nThree new joysticks were reviewed. The Euromax Professional Plus clobbered the opposition with a 97% rating, with the Cheetah\u0026rsquo;s Mach1 taking second (80%) and Euromax\u0026rsquo;s Elite narrowly coming third (78%).\nNotable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;World Games\u0026rdquo; Epyx/US Gold - 98% Gold Medal \u0026ldquo;What can I say?

Early indications were that Batman had the edge.\nLoricel\u0026rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche racing game \u0026ldquo;944 Turbo Cup\u0026rdquo;. Driver Rene Metge (\u0026ldquo;who?\u0026rdquo; asked C\u0026amp;VG) provided the endorsement and the software house hoped to include a model car in the box, but apparently British retailers weren\u0026rsquo;t so keen.\nNews hit that the highly rated \u0026ldquo;Great Giana Sisters\u0026rdquo; had been pulled from the shelves. Nintendo weren\u0026rsquo;t terribly impressed with the rather blatant Mario rip off from Rainbow Arts.\nIt seemed we may have been reaching \u0026ldquo;peak multi sporting event games\u0026rdquo; as both Martech and Tynesoft announced Circus titles. Martech\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Circus, Circus\u0026rdquo; (unreleased) would feature six events from \u0026ldquo;the Human cannonball to tight rope walking\u0026rdquo;, while Tynesoft\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Circus Games\u0026rdquo; would include trapeze, tightrope and tiger taming.\nTelecomsoft snapped up the rights to three coin-op conversions: \u0026ldquo;Mr Heli\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Bubble Bobble 2\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;P-47\u0026rdquo;. I guess they ended up losing \u0026ldquo;Bubble Bobble 2\u0026rdquo; as that didn\u0026rsquo;t appear until it was published by Ocean in the form of \u0026ldquo;Parasol Stars\u0026rdquo; (which happened to be one of the finest arcade conversions ever).\nThe PC Engine had a challenger in Japan in the form of the Sharp 68000x. Despite only having a handful of arcade ports, the quality was meant to be as good as it gets. Amusingly the news snippet referred to Tony Takoushi coming up with a \u0026ldquo;hot poop\u0026rdquo; at the machine. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing they meant \u0026ldquo;hot peep\u0026rdquo;.\nThere was a new range of cheap LCD handheld games from System, including \u0026ldquo;Formula One\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Soccer\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Tennis\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Driving\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Space\u0026rdquo;.\nSoftware house The Big Apple launched earlier in the year with some fan fare, but had only managed to deliver one game so far. That was about to change with not one but five: \u0026ldquo;Lasertrain\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Harrier Strike Mission 2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The Foolâs Errand\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Thud Ridge\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Greased Lightning\u0026rdquo;. Actually, no, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t about to change - they failed to release any further games.\nDigital Integration\u0026rsquo;s next flight sim would be \u0026ldquo;F16 Combat Pilot\u0026rdquo;.\nAlternative\u0026rsquo;s new full price label Again Again\u0026rsquo;s first title would be \u0026ldquo;The Munsters\u0026rdquo;.\nRainbird\u0026rsquo;s upcoming \u0026ldquo;Weird Dreams\u0026rdquo; was a \u0026ldquo;just plain bizarre\u0026rdquo; surreal creation from Herman Serrano which featured the \u0026ldquo;most disturbing atmosphere we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in recent times.\u0026rdquo;\nI may have spoken too soon about \u0026ldquo;peak multi sporting event games\u0026rdquo; - Electronic Arts revealed \u0026ldquo;Caveman Ugh.Lympics\u0026rdquo; which would feature dinosaur racing, T-Rex pole vaulting and whacking each other with big sticks. Thankfully that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only incoming title from EA: \u0026ldquo;Modern Wars\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Deathlord\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Powerplay Hockey\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fusion\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Powerdrome\u0026rdquo; and Games Workshop license \u0026ldquo;Chainsaw Warrior\u0026rdquo; (never released).\nFirebird\u0026rsquo;s two main releases for Christmas were \u0026ldquo;Fist+\u0026rdquo; (more of the same martial arts action, but with three players by the looks of it) and Wild West themed \u0026ldquo;Blazing Barrels\u0026rdquo; (unreleased?).\n\u0026ldquo;Hellfire Attack\u0026rdquo; from Martech was a attack chopper shoot\u0026rsquo;em up.\nFrench software house Silmarils announced a \u0026ldquo;Target Renegade\u0026rdquo; style game called \u0026ldquo;Manhattan Dealers\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Rugby League Boss\u0026rdquo; was, as the name suggests, a Rugby League management sim. There were no details other than that, so I\u0026rsquo;m guessing it was \u0026ldquo;Rugby League Manager\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the background here is, but the upcoming post-apocalyptic vehicle board game \u0026ldquo;Dark Futures\u0026rdquo; was apparently \u0026ldquo;the only cars-with-guns game of recent months not to lie under the shadow of a monstrous law suit.\u0026rdquo; This was despite being unashamedly inspired by Mad Max.\nC\u0026amp;VG were puzzled by the title of one of Ubi-Soft\u0026rsquo;s Christmas releases - \u0026ldquo;Puffyâs Saga\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I get what was wrong with that name. Other titles from them due up were \u0026ldquo;Iron Lord\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Skateball\u0026rdquo; and a space adventure that sounded similar to \u0026ldquo;Captain Blood\u0026rdquo;.\nFeatures #This month\u0026rsquo;s movie reviews were: \u0026ldquo;Big\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The House of Carroll Street\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Nico\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Demon Demon\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Consuming Passion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;A Fish Called Wanda\u0026rdquo;.\nJohn Minson visited Microprose HQ to check out a bunch of new games they were working on. The day concluded with Wild Bill Stealey taking John up for a ride in his T-28 Trojan jet trainer.\nOne side effect of Minson\u0026rsquo;s US shindig (and a long lasting hangover following the PC Show) was that he found himself lamenting the fact that UK games retailers only stocked the current top 10 chart games, whereas you could find pretty much anything you wanted in the US stores. That was actually rather insightful and sadly the chart mentality (which, if anything, hinders discoverability) is even more prominent these days.\nNotable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;R-Type\u0026rdquo; Electric Dreams - Spectrum 93% ST 85% \u0026ldquo;I did have my doubts about the Spectrum version of R-Type, but Electric Dreams has coped admirably, and the end result is fantastic!

C\u0026VG '88"},{"content":" Parallax #Sensible Software/Ocean, 1986 #This month in 1986 saw Sensible\u0026rsquo;s first big title reviewed in Zzap!64, scoring a very respectable 93% overall and receiving a Sizzler.\nOver the past few days I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to remember where I first saw \u0026ldquo;Parallax\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; I want to say it was at my friend Neil\u0026rsquo;s house, but did he even have a C64?? I know he had a Spectrum and later an Amiga\u0026hellip; Maybe it was someone else.. I\u0026rsquo;m certain that whoever it was owned an actual legit original, on disk no less (I, like most of my friends, was stuck with cassettes). I seem to recall the friend raving about it, loading it up to show me only to watch my rather unimpressed reaction. What was up with that weird title music?!\nBut at some point I got to spend quality time with it. The title music that I had found weird and annoying quickly became my favourite piece of game music ever, as it remains to this very day. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible. I think it took Galway a whole two weeks to write, which was considered a long time back then. Crazy. Years later I chatted to Martin over email and it sounded like \u0026ldquo;Parallax\u0026rdquo; was a turning point for him as he realised he was making music that he enjoyed while kicking back at home, rather than music suited to computer game store displays to attract buyers. Personally I don\u0026rsquo;t think that was a bad thing\u0026hellip;\nI loved the filmic intro - I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I had seen many examples of that before. And I loved the fact that these Sensible blokes seemed like right characters who liberally sprinkled humour throughout the game (also, was the \u0026ldquo;Your a real man now!\u0026rdquo; grammatical error intentional??).\nAs for the game itself, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t recall ever making it past the first level back then. I found the whole thing quite baffling, and was more than happy to just leave it sitting on the title screen.\nToday I set out to rectify that. I knew I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the skill or patience to get make a meaningful dent in the game, so I leant on some handy trainers. The funny thing (well, wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite so funny at the time) is that even with trainers it is entirely possible to instantly die and go straight to game over if you make the mistake of trying to progress to the next zone without having shutdown the system first (and there is no indication that I could see that a particular route would lead that way).\nThe game is hard. Like, really hard. The whole bouncing-your-ship-off- buildings/barriers/etc can quickly make it feel like you\u0026rsquo;re not in control and therefore frustrating. And don\u0026rsquo;t get me started about landing. The system with the scientists and key cards was initially confusing (particularly since the key card dropped by a scientist is random, and not specific to that spot as I would expect) - I should\u0026rsquo;ve spent some time up front experimenting with it all. Or maybe read the instructions.\nFor the final steps of completing the game I admit I had to resort to double checking a youtube video due to it not being clear where to go, with the constant threat of a sudden unexpected game over event hanging over me.\nNow, what happened next was astonishing\u0026hellip; astonishing as in a bizarrely bad and highly confusing game complete \u0026ldquo;sequence\u0026rdquo;. I think this may be one of the worst I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen. I literally had to look up whether what I had just seen was the actual end. I get the feeling Sensible just ran out of memory and/or time.\nAt any rate, 30 years on I\u0026rsquo;ve finally completed one of the most memorable games I\u0026rsquo;ve played. The game is good and worth checking out, but the music continues to be absolutely stunning - a masterpiece, and the gold standard as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned.\nZzap!64 scored it:\nPresentation 94%\nGreat title screen and many neat in-game features\nGraphics 82%\nCompetent sprites and backdrops with effective parallax scrolling.\nSound 93%\nGood FX and jingles, and a weird but wonderful piece of music on the title screen.\nHookability 90%\nThe instructions need to be read, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy enough to work out what to do without them.\nLastability 93%\nTough, demanding, and very playable.\nValue For Money 92%\nA worthy buy - if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a tenner you can still buy another copy ZZAP! [sic] with the change.\nOverall 93%\nA neat mix between a shoot em up and an arcade adventure, with a few other things thrown in for good measure.\n","date":"24 October 2016","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2016/10/24/parallax-re-visited/","section":"","summary":"","title":"\"Parallax\" Re-visited"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/sensible-software/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sensible Software"},{"content":" News #An article appeared in the Canberra Times in which a Mr Paul Gathercoal blathered on about the evils of games. Mr Gathercoal firmly believed games were corrupting the minds of children, driving them to lives of robberies, killing and masturbation. He claimed that playing \u0026ldquo;Franke Goes To Hollywood\u0026rdquo; would lead to \u0026ldquo;pill-popping\u0026rdquo;. What utter nonsense.\nGary Liddon had buggered off to Newsfield\u0026rsquo;s new software house, Thalamus, and a call went out to find someone to replace him at Zzap!.\nWith the PCW show (and Christmas, for that matter) approaching there were a tonne of announcements\u0026hellip; which included quite a few which never saw the light of day.\nInfocom had released two new adventures: the somewhat lewd \u0026ldquo;Leather Goddesses of Phobos\u0026rdquo; and Brian Moriarty\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Trinity\u0026rdquo;. The latter - a game where the player attempted to change the course of history and avert a third world war - was the second game in their \u0026ldquo;Interactive Fiction Plus\u0026rdquo; range and required a C128, disk drive and monitor capable of 80 columns (or a 16bit machine).\nGremlin were to demo a bunch of new games at the upcoming PCW Show. In addition to a C64 port of their \u0026ldquo;cult\u0026rdquo; Spectrum game, \u0026ldquo;Jack the Nipper\u0026rdquo;, there was \u0026ldquo;Future Knight\u0026rdquo;, a follow up to \u0026ldquo;Way of the Tiger\u0026rdquo; in the form of\u0026ldquo;Avenger\u0026rdquo;, a Snooker and Pool sim and footie management sim \u0026ldquo;Footballer of the Year\u0026rdquo;. Shaun Southern was also bringing his very impressive C16 3D racer \u0026ldquo;Trailblazer\u0026rdquo; to the C64. One game that was not going to be ready to show was \u0026ldquo;Pentacle\u0026rdquo;, which was suffering \u0026ldquo;technical problems\u0026rdquo;.\nMirrorsoft\u0026rsquo;s PCW stand would feature just two titles: \u0026ldquo;Raid 2000\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Strike Force Harrier\u0026rdquo;.\nElite had an impressive line up planned, with no less than five arcade conversions, two sequels and one license tie in. The arcade games making their way to the C64 were: \u0026ldquo;Paperboy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;1942\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Space Harrier\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Ikari Warriors\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Buggy Boy\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Airwolf II\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Commando II\u0026rdquo; were the sequels, and after an infamous failed attempt (featuring impossibly lush graphics), \u0026ldquo;Scooby Doo\u0026rdquo; was finally approaching completion thanks to Gargoyle Games.\nStavros Fasoulas revealed that his followup to \u0026ldquo;Sanxion\u0026rdquo; would be another shoot \u0026rsquo;em up, and would feature two new music pieces by Rob Hubbard (his most experimental yet), and sound effects by David Whittaker. I assume this was \u0026ldquo;Delta\u0026rdquo;. Thalamus had signed a \u0026ldquo;thinking man\u0026rsquo;s shoot em up\u0026rdquo; called \u0026ldquo;Starline\u0026rdquo; from new team Kinetic Designs who had cut their teeth on Compunet demos (the team included none other than Bob Stevenson).\nThe US Gold stand looked to be packed with a slew of games: arcade conversions \u0026ldquo;Gauntlet\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Xevious\u0026rdquo;, a vertical scrolling shoot \u0026rsquo;em up \u0026ldquo;Ace of the Aces\u0026rdquo;, three new games from Epyx (\u0026ldquo;Movie Monster\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;World Games\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Championship Wrestling\u0026rdquo; ), and a new 10 pin bowling game from the guys that wrote the excellent \u0026ldquo;Leaderboard\u0026rdquo; called \u0026ldquo;10th Frame\u0026rdquo;.\nZzap! apologised to KCS for getting the price and functionality of their Power Cartridge wrong.\nIt looked like this PCW Show would be a rather tame one as far as System 3 were concerned. They had gained a bit of a notorious reputation for their previous antics, but this year they would be part of Activision\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;immense\u0026rdquo; stand.

The software house was also working on a computer game based on board game \u0026ldquo;sensation\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Espionage\u0026rdquo;.\nSoftware Horizons was new on the scene and would be publishing three 16bit games within the next month or so: \u0026ldquo;Veteran\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Luxor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Mafdet\u0026rdquo;.\nChris Crawford was updating his well received \u0026ldquo;Balance of Power\u0026rdquo; with some \u0026ldquo;new trouble zones of strategic importance\u0026rdquo;. These new countries were: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Nicaragua. The update would be hitting the Amiga and PC in November as \u0026ldquo;The 1990 Edition\u0026rdquo;.\nMartech was releasing a \u0026ldquo;relatively standard addition to the shoot \u0026rsquo;em up genre\u0026rdquo; in the form of \u0026ldquo;Rex\u0026rdquo; for the 8bits.\nEA\u0026rsquo;s Accolade label was focussing on sports for the upcoming Christmas period with \u0026ldquo;Serve and Volley\u0026rdquo; (tennis), \u0026ldquo;T.K.O.\u0026rdquo; (boxing, which apparently featured \u0026ldquo;realistic broken lips\u0026rdquo;?!), \u0026ldquo;Rack\u0026rsquo;em\u0026rdquo; (snooker) and \u0026ldquo;Fast Break\u0026rdquo; (basketball).\nThe annual Golden Demon Awards took place in Nottingham. These were thrown by Games Workshop to celebrate the talents of model painters. Ivan Barfleet from Birmingham took out the top price with his \u0026ldquo;vignette of a battle mammoth\u0026rdquo;. Rather interestingly, Games Workshop head honcho Bryan Ansell teased a few enticing snippets about how they were working on a role playing game for the 16bits which would run on a central server with hundreds of players connecting.\nActivision snapped up the conversion rights for five more Sega arcade machines: \u0026ldquo;Galaxy Force\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Altered Beast\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Sonic Boom\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hot Rod\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Ace Attacker\u0026rdquo; (the last one went unreleased).\nThere was a brief mention of \u0026ldquo;Times of Lore\u0026rdquo; from Origin. The interesting thing about this back in the day - for me at any rate - was that it featured Martin Galway\u0026rsquo;s first credit since moving to the US and joining Origin. The game director was Chris Roberts, and it turns out Martin and Chris went to school together. Chris Yates (from Sensible) was credited with additional programming.

C\u0026amp;VG reassured its readers that almost all the games would make their way to the C64/Spectrum/Amstrad, and that the magazine would continue to cover those machines.\nThe Bitmap Brothers were following up their well received 16bit shoot\u0026rsquo;em up \u0026ldquo;Xenon\u0026rdquo; with a new futuristic sports game, \u0026ldquo;Speedball\u0026rdquo;.\nMirrorsoft had created a new label, Imageworks, which would be their flagship for most of its new games. The first titles to be released were: \u0026ldquo;Sky Chase\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Fernandez Must Die\u0026rdquo; and the Atari/Tengen coinop conversion, \u0026ldquo;Blasteroids\u0026rdquo;. Following those were \u0026ldquo;Foxx Strikes Back\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Bomboozal\u0026rdquo;. The latter was a puzzle game designed by a \u0026ldquo;mega-programming team\u0026rdquo; that included Jeff Minter, Andrew Braybrook, John [sic] Ritman and David Bishop. I think these esteemed developers were just contributing puzzle designs, rather than working together to create the game as a whole.\nThe Amstrad conversion of \u0026ldquo;Action Force\u0026rdquo; was finally about to be released, after suffering many delays.\n\u0026ldquo;CRISIS\u0026rdquo; was a new comic book created by some of the folk behind 2000AD.\nMastertronic was releasing a moto-cross racing game called \u0026ldquo;Motorbike Madness\u0026rdquo; for the 16bits, with 8bit conversions following.\nCRL acquired the game rights to the Kelloggs Tour Bike race, with the game to go on sale in time for the event.

There were no details as to what these would be.\nTwo new trashy movies out on video were \u0026ldquo;Hell Comes to Frogtown\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Barbarians\u0026rdquo;. Both featured old pro-wrestlers (Rowdy Roddy Piper in the former).\n\u0026ldquo;Samurai Warrior\u0026rdquo; was making its way to the Spectrum and Amstrad following a well received release on the C64.\nAdventure specialists Level 9 were about to release not one but two new games: \u0026ldquo;Lancelot\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gnome II: Ingridâs Back\u0026rdquo;.\nThe software house profiled this month was Telecomsoft.\nFeatures #Hot on the heels of the release of \u0026ldquo;Starglider II\u0026rdquo;, Julian Rignall visited Argonaut to talk to Jez San.\nThere was a somewhat odd feature about a new compilation from US Gold (\u0026ldquo;odd\u0026rdquo; as in, \u0026ldquo;why did this get a whole feature?\u0026rdquo;).\nThe movies reviewed this month were: \u0026ldquo;Coming to America\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Beetlejuice\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Poltergeist III\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Vice Versa\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Shag\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Bloodsport\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Hawks\u0026rdquo;.\nC\u0026amp;VG checked out IMAX theatres and Super X simulators (cut down hydraulic flight simulators).\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if teenager me fared better, but some of the page layout, font size and colour choices in the newly designed C\u0026amp;VG were bafflingly bad. I was unable to read the vast majority of John Minson\u0026rsquo;s rant due to a lot of the text (black) being on a very dark blue background.

I had faith.\nOn Friday night I sat down to watch it and it did not disappoint. They nailed it. This is the best documentary on the games industry I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, and I consider it essential viewing for people already in the industry or those looking to get in. So much of what happens now has happened before - just patterns that repeat.\nOf course, it won\u0026rsquo;t mean as much people who weren\u0026rsquo;t into the \u0026rsquo;80s UK game scene and may not be familiar with the names, but I think the interviewees are interesting/charming/funny enough that there\u0026rsquo;s still plenty to enjoy.\nMost importantly, the stories of these pioneers needs to be recorded before they\u0026rsquo;re gone. It was an incredible period with many remarkable achievements.\nThis is a project that deserves to be supported, so go and order a copy (the Special Edition is worth it ), and enjoy some wonderful anecdotes from some pretty amazing people who played a vital role in making games what they are today.\n","date":"12 October 2014","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2014/10/12/from-bedrooms-to-billions/","section":"","summary":"","title":"From Bedrooms To Billions"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/frombedroomstobillions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"FromBedroomsToBillions"},{"content":" News #Ariolasoft spun out two new software houses, 39 Steps to focus on adventure games and Reaktor arcade/action games.

Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The magazine had set out to cover \u0026ldquo;every aspect of life\u0026rdquo; for the youth audience, but was seen as being \u0026ldquo;too widely targeted\u0026rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy sales.\nThe closure of LM brought some changes at Crash. Ciaran Brennan, who had started as editor of Crash last month, was moved over to Zzap and a new section of Video Reviews was introduced.\nElsewhere, Argus closed its Computer Gamer and ZX Monthly magazines due to poor sales.\nMelbourne House ditched their Inspector Gadget game citing problems with the Spectrum program.

Small software houses were finding it hard to compete with the likes of Ocean, and the big companies were more risk averse and focussed on attracting customers with flashy graphics and advertising. On the plus side, software was much easier to find on the high street and developers could go through publishers which allowed them to concentrate on writing the games rather than marketing and distribution.\nThe first video reviews to feature in Crash were:\n\u0026ldquo;Invaders from Mars\u0026rdquo; 40% \u0026ldquo;The Monster Club\u0026rdquo; 70% Notable Previews # \u0026ldquo;Tai-Pan\u0026rdquo; Sentient Software/Ocean \u0026ldquo;Renegade\u0026rdquo; Ocean \u0026ldquo;Mag Max\u0026rdquo; Imagine \u0026ldquo;Wizball\u0026rdquo; Ocean \u0026ldquo;Mutants\u0026rdquo; Ocean \u0026ldquo;Micronaut One\u0026rdquo; Pete Cooke/Nexus \u0026ldquo;Hades Nebula\u0026rdquo; Nexus \u0026ldquo;Road Runner\u0026rdquo; US Gold \u0026ldquo;Indiana Jones\u0026rdquo; US Gold \u0026ldquo;Zynaps\u0026rdquo; Dominic Robinson/Hewson \u0026ldquo;Howard the Duck\u0026rdquo; Activision \u0026ldquo;Milk Race\u0026rdquo; Mastertronic \u0026ldquo;Murder on the Atlantic\u0026rdquo; Infogrames Notable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Hydrofool\u0026rdquo; Gargoyle Games - 90% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;A first class sequel, entertaining, addictive and highly amusing.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Pawn\u0026rdquo; Magnetic Scrolls - 90% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;Really engaging, complex adventuring.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Shadows of Mordor\u0026rdquo; Beam/Melbourne House - 93% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;Shadows of Mordor looks a very interesting game.

Graeme Kidd was now to be editor of the ill fated LM magazine.\nSpring had arrived and there were a slew of announcements by software houses of upcoming games. Some of the notable ones included:\n\u0026ldquo;Ikari Warriors\u0026rdquo; - Elite \u0026ldquo;Krakout\u0026rdquo; - Gremlin \u0026ldquo;Thing Bounces Back\u0026rdquo; - Gremlin \u0026ldquo;Heavy on the Magick II\u0026rdquo; - Gargoyle Games (the third part in the trilogy was also mentioned, but was never released) \u0026ldquo;Get Dexter\u0026rdquo; - Ere Informatique \u0026ldquo;Taipan\u0026rdquo; - Ocean \u0026ldquo;Rampage\u0026rdquo; - Ocean \u0026ldquo;Renegade\u0026rdquo; - Imagine \u0026ldquo;Fight Night\u0026rdquo; - US Gold \u0026ldquo;Gauntlet II\u0026rdquo; - US Gold \u0026ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u0026rdquo; - US Gold The Power House (a sublabel of CRL) announced that every game they released would contain either a free game or audio track. The inhouse music ensemble would be headed by Wayne Allen of House Electronic Xperience. The first title to have a track included was to be \u0026ldquo;Tomb of Syrinx\u0026rdquo;.\nDomark moved in to their new offices in Wimbledon.\nMartech admitted there was a balls up during duplication of \u0026ldquo;Uchi Mata\u0026rdquo; (which scored a rather dismal 36% in this issue) and a number of copies that were sent to distributors were actually pre-release previews rather than the full game.\nChanges were afoot at Thalamus (the Newsfield owned software house): Andy Wright and Gary Liddon had left the company for \u0026ldquo;pastures new.\u0026rdquo; Paul Cooper was now running the show.\nRumours were circulating about a +3 Spectrum which would feature a disk drive instead of a cassette player. In the article about the Z88, a \u0026ldquo;STOP PRESS\u0026rdquo; footnote was added which said Amstrad had indeed announced the +3.\nA complete lack of gaming leads resulted in a desperate Minson attending the launches of WordStar 4 (yes, the word processor), a word processor from Borland and a spreadsheet from Neric. The WordStar launch was notable for the fact that, when it came time to demo the program on stage, it completely refused to work.\nSir Clive Sinclair was busy working on a new portable computer, the Z88. The machine featured a small LCD, was about the size of an A4 pad, weighed less than two pounds and would run for up to 20 hours on four Walkman batteries (though Sinclair had a tendency to overstate battery life).

Nintendo seemed unphased by the move, saying that they had never lost a lawsuit.\nConfusion reigned over the specifics for the Konix Slipstream. TGM attempted to clear things up by confirming that it would retail at Â£150 (or slightly higher), have a set of peripherals (hydraulic chair, light gun, 3D helmet), some of which would be included with the console (not the chair!), and it would use 3.5\u0026quot; floppies. TGM promised full coverage next month with a review.\nSoftware house Teque had formed a new label called Chrysalis which would \u0026ldquo;concentrate on original ideas rather than tie-ins.\u0026rdquo; They actually ended up using the name Krisalis due to a dispute with Chrsysalis Records. The first game would be \u0026ldquo;Prison\u0026rdquo;.\nThe first Novagen game that wasn\u0026rsquo;t coded by Paul Woakes would be \u0026ldquo;Hellbent\u0026rdquo;. However, there were hints that Woakes had in fact been working on it, perhaps explaining the delays of the hotly anticipated \u0026ldquo;Damocles\u0026rdquo;.\nCode Masters were turning their attention to the 16bit machines. \u0026ldquo;Advanced Rugby\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Advanced Ski\u0026rdquo; would be the initial releases. The rugby game doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to have made it out.\nLondon-base distributor SDL announced it was selling Amiga and ST bundles for the same price as the regular base system. The 1040 STF would come with 22 games, organiser software and a joystick for Â£499, with the options of adding a suite of business software for an extra Â£100. The Amiga 500 bundle would include 10 games, but no price was given.\nFeatures # A new series was started in which Jez San and his team at Argonaut Software would discuss the state and progress of their new flight sim game referred to as \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo;. In this first instalment, Jez talked about some of the challenges 3D presented and Christopher Humphries reported on some debugging features he had added. Both parts were surprisingly detailed and rather interesting. It looks like this was referring to what would become \u0026ldquo;Birds of Prey\u0026rdquo;. Mel Croucher looked at the trend of people paying lots of money on collecting rare game and toy products, and interviewed a couple of people from auctioneers Christie. TGM investigated the new, exciting technology that would \u0026ldquo;promise an incredible future of long-distance games\u0026rdquo;: ISDN. They imagined a multiplayer \u0026ldquo;Elite\u0026rdquo; where movie quality sound and video would be streamed in. Mel\u0026rsquo;s second piece was a plea to the games industry to invest more money in games which weren\u0026rsquo;t all about death and destruction - games with more positive, constructive goals and themes. His fear was not that violence in games resulted in players mirroring the violence in real life, but that the result was desensitisation.

Domark reported that sales had already surpassed 15000 before 1987 began (a good amount, given that it had only been on the shelves for about a month), and with the extensive Smiths chain now also stocking the game things were looking good.\nTwo new software houses launched. VonSoft rather bizarrely stated they expected to capture 5-10% of the market with 20 releases in the first 4 months of 1987. They had announced one game, \u0026ldquo;A.R.E.N.A.\u0026rdquo;, which was never released and appears to have been the only game they ever had in the works. The other company, Alternative Software, faired a lot better becoming a well established budget label (though their first release, \u0026ldquo;Howzat\u0026rdquo; was reviewed in this issue and scored 11% \u0026ldquo;Howzat is truly a screamer.

Simple. You turn the machine off after getting a fresh listing (I hope you have a printer!), then go and get a beer or a coffee, and look at the listing very, very carefully for half an hour.

Costing a mere Â£149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would be able to read software from standard 3\u0026quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce - customers could look forward to paying only 15 quid for games. The CPU was previously thought to be an 8086, but it was now revealed they were going with a 68000. This would be accompanied by 4 customised co-processors and an \u0026ldquo;extremely fast\u0026rdquo; (70 mips) blitter. Peripherals lined up for launch included the hydraulic chair and 3D helmet.\nIn other vapourware news, Atari promised a sub-Â£100 console built with ST technology for the middle of the year. Not to be out done by announcing products that would never see the light of day, Commodore announced a new Amiga/PC hybrid - the 2000AT. The machine would feature an IBM PC-AT emulation mode to enable it to run all PC software, and would cost Â£1500.\nUS Gold managed to grab the rights to publish Lucasfilm games in the UK from Domark.\nBoots refused to stock System 3\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Last Ninja 2\u0026rdquo; after the software house put rubber shurikens in 25,000 \u0026ldquo;limited edition\u0026rdquo; copies of the game. Other retailers were reportedly removing the offending items by hand or placing warning stickers on the boxes.\nProblems came to light with Amstrad\u0026rsquo;s new Spectrum +2 (known as the +2A). Due to a change in the positions of expansion slots and a lack of 9V output to power peripherals, many 3rd party add-ons could not be used. To make matters worse, changes to the OS resulted in incompatibilities in some software. Amstrad\u0026rsquo;s woes didn\u0026rsquo;t end there: customers who forked over Â£343 for a new Sinclair Professional PC 200 discovered MS-DOS, the GEM 3 environment and GW- BASIC were missing from the package. This was apparently due to a delay which would be rectified soon, but that probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t much comfort to those who found themselves with effectively useless computers.\nAudiogenic were to try to attract more women by publishing \u0026ldquo;cuddly games\u0026rdquo; and sports simulations with female athletes as sponsors. \u0026ldquo;I think the whole aura that surrounds computers is male-oriented. Even when you have got women involved they tend to get desensitised and brainwashed,\u0026rdquo; observed Managing Director Peter Calver.\nPrinter prices were set to rise significantly - up to 47% more - after the EEC ruled that Japanese manufacturers were unfairly undercutting European and American competitors.\nVAT came into effect in the UK this month.\nSony, Panasonic and Sanyo had all released new MSX 2+ computers in order to compete with the Amiga \u0026amp; ST. Technically they were impressive in someways (19268 colours), but less so in others (the CPU was an 8-bit Z80). There was no date given when they would be available in the UK.\nAfter having to pull copies of their side scrolling shooter \u0026ldquo;Katakis\u0026rdquo; from the shelves due to legal action for similarities to \u0026ldquo;R-Type\u0026rdquo;, US Gold revealed the German developers (Rainbow Arts, with Factor 5 handling the Amiga conversion) were hard at work rewriting it so it would be totally legal. Factor 5 changed the gameplay and levels \u0026ldquo;slightly\u0026rdquo; and the game was re- released as \u0026ldquo;Denaris\u0026rdquo;.\nFeatures # Marshal M Rosenthal attended the Commodore show in Philadelphia. The vibe at the show was extremely positive, with a lot of excitement for the potential of the Amiga machines. Judging by what was on show, it seemed that this was the dawning of a new age for artists in particular. The C64 was represented, but had been very much relegated to the side lines. \u0026ldquo;The Gift of the Guppie\u0026rdquo; was the title of an article by Mel Croucher which looked at some recent examples of stupid gizmos for gullible people with too much money. Rob Steel took a look back the adventure game highlights and lowlights of 1988. A rather odd piece on \u0026ldquo;PCA\u0026rdquo; from The Electric Ephemeiris which was a fully feature astrological application. Some alternative software was mentioned as well as reading material. A look at the technical details of the upcoming SAM Coupe machine which could run much Spectrum software while boasting 256K RAM, 64 colours and 7 channel sound. With the Konix Slipstream, rumoured Sega Megadelve [sic] and Nintendo II machines due to hit the high street in the coming months, TGM pondered what it would take for a new machine to be successful against such stiff competition. Could Acorn turn the failing Archimedes around? Did the SAM Coupe stand a chance?

I jumped in within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games, particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think twice. It\u0026rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride since then - the behind the scenes videos are the best accounts of game development ever committed to film, and I almost don\u0026rsquo;t want them to finish the game as that will mean the end of them. Earlier this week Double Fine released part 1 to the backers, while opening up pre- orders for everyone else. I started and finished the game over a period of a few hours yesterday. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly quite short, which should come as no surprise, but it really is a beautiful, charming game. At no point did it make me feel stupid, and there were a number of genuinely funny bits.

A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned all those talented programmers weren\u0026rsquo;t going to suddenly jump ship to the new platforms. If only Amstrad could sort out the technical problems with the 128K\u0026hellip;\nFeatures # Lloyd Mangram took a lengthy look back at the Crash mags of 1986 and the big events and games in the Spectrum scene. Mel Croucher began a fictional series called \u0026ldquo;Tamara Knight\u0026rdquo; that would grace the pages of Crash throughout 1987. Staff of Crash, ZZap and Amtix challenged each other to a series of gaming contests. Julian Rignall (ZZap) was pipped to the post by Ben Stone (Crash), with the Amtix contingent trailing far behind. Denton Designs had been one of the darlings of the UK game industry, but things looked decidedly shaky early on in 1986 when they delivered a right stinker of a game (\u0026ldquo;Transformers\u0026rdquo;) and the founders left the company. Julian Rignall talked to the remaining members, and to the founders who had gone on to pastures anew. Money was the main problem - they just weren\u0026rsquo;t earning enough from their games to support a relatively large programming staff. One of those who left, John Gibson, had struck a solo contracting deal with Ocean doing arcade ports and said: \u0026ldquo;It was great when we started, and we had loads of ideas about being a software development house. At first it was like us versus the rest of the world, but after a while both Steve and I got disillusioned. There was too much turmoil in the office with too many meetings. All I wanted to do was write programs and I felt that I was getting too wound up by the difficulty of running a company.\u0026rdquo; There was an interview with Roger Kean, the man behind Newsfield\u0026rsquo;s new publication, LM.

After the previous few titles had failed to live up to the developer\u0026rsquo;s usual incredibly high standards, C\u0026amp;VG feared the magic had started to wane but hoped these new games would put them back on top.\nGeoff Brown from US Gold had taken delivery of a new red Ferrari, which cost Â£74,000.

Both games would turn out to be fantastic.\nThe excellent \u0026ldquo;Shadowfire\u0026rdquo; was to receive a followup in the form of \u0026ldquo;Enigma Force\u0026rdquo;.

Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly enthusiastic about the Konix Slipstream: \u0026ldquo;I think Konix has the potential to be another Amstrad.

While the event was usually held in the \u0026ldquo;cavernous\u0026rdquo; Royal Horticultural Hall, a booking mixup meant this one had to move to \u0026ldquo;several rooms and various floors\u0026rdquo; at Central Hall in Westminster. There were very few new products to talk about, the only ones receiving a mention being \u0026ldquo;The Professional Adventure Writing System\u0026rdquo;, a new disk interface from Rockfort called \u0026ldquo;The Disciple\u0026rdquo; and Romantic Robot\u0026rsquo;s video digitiser.

In another somewhat smug snippet, it was noted that a recent new arrival at the news agent (\u0026ldquo;BANG\u0026rdquo; magazine) had folded after just 10 issues.\nThere was some controversy after IJK released \u0026ldquo;Crime Busters\u0026rdquo;, a game which Mastertronic took considerable exception to due to its window UI system bearing more than a passing resemblance to that featured in David Jones\u0026rsquo; Magic Knight games (even the character set was the same).

The main one would be a \u0026ldquo;super ST\u0026rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a \u0026ldquo;Pocket PC\u0026rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by Â£100 and get a software bundle valued at Â£440. How many of these would actually hit the selves?\nPerhaps an indication of the reasons behind Atari\u0026rsquo;s aggressive moves, Commodore posted profits of Â£32 million.\nElectronic Arts was finishing up the legendary Deluxe Paint II for the Amiga.\nPeople were beginning to question whether Nintendo could succeed in the UK. Only 40,000 consoles had been sold but Nintendo were adamant sales would pick up.\nThe public unveiling of the SAM computer would take place in December. MGT - the company being the SAM - had just signed a deal that would allow it to package up five to twelve Spectrum games on \u0026ldquo;software albums\u0026rdquo;.\nThe rumours surrounding Amstrad\u0026rsquo;s 16 bit gaming machine continued, and were still completely contradictory. Spectrum based gaming machine or a 4 colour PC aimed at business?\nFeatures # TGM visited Microprose HQ in the US to find out what the company had in the works. \u0026ldquo;F-19 Stealth Fighter\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Samuari\u0026rdquo; (a sort of successor to \u0026ldquo;Pirates!\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;Covert Action\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Times of Lore\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Red Storm Rising\u0026rdquo; and a certain footie game only referred to as \u0026ldquo;Soccer\u0026rdquo; were shown. The company itself seemed to be going from strength to strength and was valued at over $20 million. They also treated their staff well, with a profit sharing scheme, the latest equipment and a great environment. Sadly things changed when they sold to Spectrum Holobyte, which was the beginning of the end. Somewhat oddly, the article refers to Origin as being a division of Microprose. \u0026ldquo;Whatever happened to the Nintendo?\u0026rdquo; read the headline of an article questioning Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s relevance. While the NES had seen considerable success in the US, the same wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same in the UK. Would this whole console thing last in the face of the 16bit home computers which provided many of the same games and actually allowed kids to learn how to program? The conclusion seemed to be that the quality controlled exclusive games and a big marketing push should turn things around. Mel Croucher continued his look into computer crime in the wake of what was the biggest ever attempted computer fraud. The fake transaction (Â£32 million quids worth) was only discovered as the computerised system experienced a failure while it was being processed so it had to be checked by hand. Brian Fargo, the producer/director at Interplay, was interview about their upcoming \u0026ldquo;Neuromancer\u0026rdquo; game. Interestingly, it was Timothy Leary - a friend of Fargo\u0026rsquo;s - who introduced him to the book. Leary had secured the rights to the game from the movie producers (25 years on and we\u0026rsquo;re still waiting for that movie) and had approached EA. That deal fell through, as did a subsequent deal with Activision, and Interplay managed to grab the rights. Also mentioned was \u0026ldquo;Battle Chess\u0026rdquo;, which ended up being one of the killer apps for the Amiga. Mel Croucher examined the hitech gizmos that were starting to appear in cars. Route navigation, dashboard computers, HUDs and E-Keys were discussed. Mel\u0026rsquo;s predictions haven\u0026rsquo;t quite come to pass, though \u0026ldquo;Maybe the most ironic aspect of computerised cars is the fact that as they become common, the 1990s will see the beginning of the end of rush hours and daily trips to the office, shops and schools.\u0026rdquo; Notable Previews # \u0026ldquo;Hostages\u0026rdquo; from Infogrammes. \u0026ldquo;Chrono Quest\u0026rdquo; by Infomedia, published by Psygnosis. \u0026ldquo;Bamboo\u0026rdquo; was teased as the new game by Boys Without Brains which would be published by Thalamus.

Steve Marsden and David Cooke (of \u0026ldquo;Techinician Ted\u0026rdquo; fame) were working on \u0026ldquo;City Slicker\u0026rdquo;. Melbourne House were showing off \u0026ldquo;Fist II\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dodgy Geezers\u0026rdquo; (from the guys who wrote \u0026ldquo;Hampstead\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Terrormolinos\u0026rdquo;). Pete Cooke\u0026rsquo;s new game was revealed to be \u0026ldquo;Academy\u0026rdquo;, a follow up to \u0026ldquo;Tau Ceti\u0026rdquo;. This game blew me away with its depth - you could even completely customise the HUD. CRL announced that the much hyped \u0026ldquo;Cyborg\u0026rdquo; was coming to the Spectrum. Well, it never actually arrived and the C64 game itself was a complete disappointment. \u0026ldquo;3D Game Maker\u0026rdquo; looked interesting - it promised the ability to create Ultimate style isometric games. CRL had a couple of other games in production, namely \u0026ldquo;Doctor What!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Room 10\u0026rdquo;. I had the latter for the C64 and actually rather enjoyed it, though perhaps that was partly due to the fact that I had shelled out my hard earned cash for it. Elite had a two new arcade conversions in the pipeline. The first would be \u0026ldquo;Paperboy\u0026rdquo; followed by \u0026ldquo;1942\u0026rdquo;. Elite announced that it had rebooted \u0026ldquo;Scooby Doo\u0026rdquo;. It had been one of the most hyped games ever up until that point and the inhouse development had been abandoned as the gameplay \u0026ldquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t live up to the ambitious concept.\u0026rdquo; Gargoyle Games were brought on board and managed to do a decent job (albeit a very different game than what was originally planned). Alligata announced \u0026ldquo;Pub Games\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Vandal\u0026rdquo;. Macmillan had formed a new label, Piranha, and had an impressive line up of games on the way. Don Priestly\u0026rsquo;s excellent \u0026ldquo;The Trap Door\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Rogue Trooper\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Nosferatu\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Strike Force Delta\u0026rdquo; were revealed. Piranha had managed to grab the license for Terry Pratchett\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Colour of Magic\u0026rdquo; and signed up the brilliant Delta4 to develop it. AdventureSoft were continuing to bring Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson\u0026rsquo;s adventure books to computer with \u0026ldquo;Temple of Terror\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sword of the Samurai\u0026rdquo;. A work by Isaac Asimov was being used as the basis for a futuristic adventure called \u0026ldquo;Kayleth\u0026rdquo;. Durrell were readying \u0026ldquo;Chain Reaction\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Killer DOS\u0026rdquo; (which never saw the light of day), Clive Townsend\u0026rsquo;s excellent \u0026ldquo;Saboteur II\u0026rdquo; and Mike Richardson\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Thanatos\u0026rdquo;. Rather interestingly, a remake of \u0026ldquo;Thanatos\u0026rdquo; is in production by Automata. Palace Software were busy working on \u0026ldquo;The Sacred Armour of Antiriad\u0026rdquo;. Argus Press Software announced a bunch of games from its various labels. \u0026ldquo;Wibstars\u0026rdquo; was a spoof game based on the software distribution industry where the player was put in charge of shipping \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo;. Quicksilva had two games, \u0026ldquo;Star Wars\u0026rdquo; (based on the satellite defence program, not the movie - unclear if this actually came out), and \u0026ldquo;Glider Rider\u0026rdquo;. Mind Games had \u0026ldquo;TimeTrax\u0026rdquo;. Strategy specialists Lothlorien were finishing up two games: \u0026ldquo;Johnny Reb II\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Legions of Death\u0026rdquo;. And finally, \u0026ldquo;Miami Dice\u0026rdquo; was a craps game from Bug-Byte. A follow up to the great \u0026ldquo;Fairlight\u0026rdquo; was on its way from The Edge. \u0026ldquo;Fairlight II\u0026rdquo; expanded on the original in pretty much every way and would include the ability to switch between two characters. Also due for release were \u0026ldquo;Mindstone\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Psi Chess\u0026rdquo;, and an arcade conversion of \u0026ldquo;Shao-Lin\u0026rsquo;s Road\u0026rdquo;. An adventure creator called \u0026ldquo;Dreamscape\u0026rdquo; was teased. It would be based on Bo Jangeborg\u0026rsquo;s graphics utility \u0026ldquo;Grax\u0026rdquo; which he used for the Fairlight games. Sadly it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like this was ever released. Odin announced its next game would be \u0026ldquo;I.C.U.P.S.\u0026rdquo;, and would be published under its Thor sublabel. Firebird detailed several of its upcoming games. \u0026ldquo;Hive\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Future Games\u0026rdquo; (oddly enough this ended up being released by Mastertronic),\u0026ldquo;Empire\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Druid\u0026rdquo; were due to hit the shelves by Christmas. Mikro-Gen\u0026rsquo;s next game would be \u0026ldquo;SAS Strike Force\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Frostbite\u0026rdquo; was also mentioned as being the next game by Dave Perry, though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like that was actually by him. Gargoyle Games had formed a new label, FTL (Faster Than Light), which would be publishing original arcade games (at the rate of 5 a year!). First up was \u0026ldquo;Lightforce\u0026rdquo; which showed of their new technique (called \u0026ldquo;Lasermation\u0026rdquo;) to hide the Spectrum\u0026rsquo;s colour clash problems. Following that would be \u0026ldquo;Shockway Rider\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Samurai Dawn\u0026rdquo; (which never saw a release). They also teased a new game called \u0026ldquo;George\u0026rdquo; which was \u0026ldquo;an executive type game involving lots of artificial intelligence techniques, aimed primarily at data processing professionals.\u0026rdquo; Notable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Dan Dare\u0026rdquo; Virgin - 92% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;A game which lives up to the image of the cartoon character.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Stainless Steel\u0026rdquo; Dave Perry/Mikro-Gen - 89% \u0026ldquo;A slick shoot\u0026rsquo;em up without too much depth.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Dynamite Dan II\u0026rdquo; Mirrorsoft - 93% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;A very worthy successor to Dynamite Dan I!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Boggit\u0026rdquo; Delta4/CRL - 90% Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;This game is awarded a SMASH not just because it is amusing at the expense of a game and a theme familiar to everyone but due to its standing as an adventure - the game reads well, plays well, and the presentation is slick and polished to a tee.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure\u0026rdquo; St Bride\u0026rsquo;s School/CRL - 82% \u0026ldquo;Certainly the Big Cave Adventure offers a great deal; it\u0026rsquo;s not only a super spoof but a polished and well orchestrated adventure in its own right.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Graphic Adventure Creator\u0026rdquo; Incentive - Crash Smash \u0026ldquo;The response to this product should be extraordinary.\u0026rdquo; ","date":"29 September 2013","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2013/9/29/this-month-in-crash-86/","section":"","summary":"","title":"This month in...

The Oliver Twins have been prominent members of the UK games industry since they shot to fame in the 80s for their much loved Dizzy series of games. I\u0026rsquo;ve never met them myself, but everyone I know that has has nothing but glowing things to say about them - they\u0026rsquo;ve been an immense help to many UK developers.\nLast year Blitz mounted a KickStarter campaign to revive Dizzy, but it was a pretty flawed attempt which failed.\n","date":"15 September 2013","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2013/9/15/blitz-games-closes-down/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Blitz Games closes down"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/blitzgames/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"BlitzGames"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/dizzy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dizzy"},{"content":" News #Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST.\nA small South Wales company called Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) was about to release a Spectrum \u0026ldquo;super clone\u0026rdquo;. The SAM would feature 256K standard, upgradeable to 512K. Retailers doubted whether it could make an impact, and so it was only going to be available by mail order.\nCode Masters confirmed it was moving in to full price games. The first was rumoured to be an Activision reject. The company also said that it was going to start producing games aimed at girls.\nTelecomsoft and Hewson resolved their legal conflict over two Graftgold games (\u0026ldquo;Morpheus\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Magnetron\u0026rdquo;). The dispute arose at the previous year\u0026rsquo;s PCW Show when Telecomsoft lured Andrew Braybrook and Steve Turner away from Hewson.\nAccording to Gallup, the Spectrum (24%), C64 (17%) and Amstrad (15%) still accounted for at least 45% of all home computers in Britain despite the arrival of the ST and Amiga. 8bit software sales also increased substantially\nwere 16bit owners still buying 8bit games for their old machines? Rumours continued about a possible 16bit games machine from Amstrad. Details continued to be contradictory (it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expansion ports, but it would be called the Sinclair Professional PC etc).\nWalt Disney announced that for the first time they would be using computers for the animation in \u0026ldquo;Oliver and Company\u0026rdquo;. The final cells would still be hand painted, though.\nApple posted a three month profit of US $91.3 million, 71% more than the same period the previous year. The growth was attributed to the success of the Mac II.\nMirrorsoft launched a new label: Imageworks. The focus would be on new, original content rather than arcade ports and licenses. The first title was \u0026ldquo;Skychase\u0026rdquo; from a small US company called Maxis, with several big name developers signed up for more. Jon Ritman and Jeff Minter were contributing to a new game by Tony Crowther and David Bishop (\u0026ldquo;Bomb Uzal\u0026rdquo;), Denton Designs was working on \u0026ldquo;Foxx Fights Back\u0026rdquo;, and The Bitmap Brothers were cracking away at a \u0026ldquo;futuristic sport game\u0026rdquo; called \u0026ldquo;Speedball\u0026rdquo;.\nThree former Sinclair Research people had formed a company to produce a new games machine called the Flare One. Rather strangely they had opted for a Z80 with two custom chips and 768K of RAM. The group had approached Amstrad with the machine, but were turned away and now another unnamed company was interested. From what I can tell, it never came out.\nFeatures # TGM sounded the warning of computer crime which had, for the first time, eclipsed the money stolen by traditional methods. Bank accounts, credit cards and so on were all vulnerable and there seemed little that could be done about it. The Archimedes received a full feature, with a series of reviews. Rather than do his usual column, Mel Croucher instead published a rebuttal penned by another TGM writer to his previous month\u0026rsquo;s column arguing that the cases he had put forward for film makers plagarising other works were at best weak. A huge preview of the Personal Computer Show, detailing what could be expected from all the stands and the various other events. There was a look at the options for TV viewers in the UK. With Murdoch and Maxwell both launching satellite services there was an ever increasing variety of channels on offer. But the satellite companies were losing money hand over fist - could this trend be turned around? TGMs look at all things Cyberpunk continued, this month focussing on the books of William Gibson and others (Bruce Sterling, Walter Jon Williams, Michael Swanwick, Michael Weaver and Lucius Shepard). The third round of qualifying for the Computer Games Championship took place. 10 competitors remained and would go on to the PC Show where the winner would be decided. Notable Previews # Domark laid out their upcoming releases \u0026ldquo;Return of the Jedi\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Live and Let Die\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning\u0026rdquo;, and the official \u0026ldquo;Spitting Image\u0026rdquo; game. A new shooter from Thalamus was due for release in September. \u0026ldquo;Armaltye\u0026rdquo; was hyped to be the best shooter yet on the C64. Andrew Braybrook\u0026rsquo;s new game was revealed to be \u0026ldquo;Intensity\u0026rdquo; and would be published by Firebird. \u0026ldquo;Powerdrome\u0026rdquo; was the first EA game developed in the UK and was due to hit the selves in September. EA had several other games up their sleeves, including \u0026ldquo;Battle Chess\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Neuromancer\u0026rdquo;. The latter would feature a sound track by Devo.

The game was, of course, \u0026ldquo;The Chaos Engine\u0026rdquo;.\nRussian puzzle games seemed to be all the rage and Infogrammes had gotten the rights to publish Dimitri Paskhov\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Colors\u0026rdquo;.

When news arrived that Bob Jacob (founder of Cinemaware) had started a new company, the writing was on the wall. The games that were still in development were to see a release, though, as Mirrorsoft had bought the rights to the company name.\nSystem 3 delayed the release of its next two games - \u0026ldquo;The Last Ninja 3\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Myth\u0026rdquo; - until September.\nProgress on Ocean\u0026rsquo;s forthcoming \u0026ldquo;Terminator 2\u0026rdquo; game was set back as the artist (Kevin Bulmer) had his house broken into and all his computer gear + disks nicked.

There was also a mention of \u0026ldquo;Ultima Underworlds\u0026rdquo;. Neither game was ever planned for the Amiga. With the news that Atari had binned plans for its Panther console, The One got to have a go on a dev kit to see what would have been. The decision to pull the plug came quite late, with some software houses (Psygnosis etc) already having games for it in development. Kids TV show \u0026ldquo;Knightmare\u0026rdquo; was back for a fifth series, and The One had a look behind the scenes. A rather crap game based on the show had been previously released for 8bit machines, but now Mindscape were readying what was hoped to be a better outing for the Amiga.

The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it\u0026rsquo;s destiny would be games.\nSugar\u0026rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch\u0026rsquo;s Sky satellite TV company which would see Amstrad producing and selling Â£199 dishes that would receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following year. Robert Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s BSB was also in the running, but had received some scorn due to adopting an arguably superior format other than PAL meaning separate dishes would be required.\nCode Masters were about to move into full price (Â£9.99) games. No titles were mentioned, but rather than going for more complex games they would be throwing in freebies (tshirts etc).\nEA\u0026rsquo;s lineup for Apple computers (II, IIgs and Mac) would finally be released in the UK.\nA slightly odd line of products was released by Trilogic whereby old C64/128 machines could be re-used by new Amiga owners as printer buffers. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure just how much need for this there was.\nAmstrad was gearing up to launch a new computer to take on the 16bit machines. It would be called the Sinclair Professional PC, cost Â£299 and run MS-DOS. Scepticism was high over its ability to compete with the Amiga: \u0026ldquo;it can\u0026rsquo;t be both a PC compatible and an Amiga-killer.\u0026rdquo; Meanwhile, it looked like Amstrad was determined to sell off its stock of Spectrum +2s and +3s - was a +4 on the way? There were also completely contradictory reports of the fate of Amstrad\u0026rsquo;s rumoured low cost (Â£50) console - it was either cancelled with the team having left the company, or \u0026ldquo;hundreds of thousands\u0026rdquo; of units had been ordered.\nCD manufacturer Nimbus expressed concerns that the new format may only actually last up to 8 years before deterioating, rather than the much promoted \u0026ldquo;lifetime\u0026rdquo;. In other CD news, Sony had begun production of mini CDs for singles after a pronounced argument with Philips over the fact the new size would not play in some players. The compromise would be to include a ring adapter.\nToshiba were manufacturing full colour LCD TV screens that were 4\u0026quot; across. TGM were somewhat baffled as to why such a thing would be made\u0026hellip;\nWH Smith, Boots and Woolworths were putting their combined feet down over irregular shaped game boxes that were causing them considerable annoyance to stock on shelves. From now on, only a small set of box sizes would be allowed\nFeatures # Mel Croucher took on people claiming their creative endeavours were original - \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;there is no such thing as a new idea. All ideas and treatments of those ideas are recycled time and time again.\u0026rdquo; He cited a number of examples from the movie industry: \u0026ldquo;Back to the Future\u0026rdquo; (an episode of \u0026ldquo;Lost in Space\u0026rdquo;), \u0026ldquo;Blade Runner\u0026rdquo; (an episode of \u0026ldquo;Star Trek\u0026rdquo;), and \u0026ldquo;Star Wars\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;The Snow Queen\u0026rdquo;). TGM\u0026rsquo;s series on Cyberpunk continued, this month looking at Cyberpunk on the screen. \u0026ldquo;Aliens\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Blade Runner\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Max Headroom\u0026rdquo; were all discussed in some depth. The first home release of \u0026ldquo;Dragon\u0026rsquo;s Lair\u0026rdquo; arrived for the ST and received a full feature. It all seemed to stackup well against the original, but at Â£99.95 for the laser disc, Â£19.95 for the cable and Â£400-800 for the disc player it\u0026rsquo;d be hard to justify. Mel Croucher surveyed various video gismos to enhance one\u0026rsquo;s video work: titlers, microphones, fader/mixers, enhancers and even designer raincoats for camcorders. A silly piece on haunted computers of press publications. The first National Computer Games Championship held in Britain was under way with the first few rounds having been completed. Notable Previews # Audiogenic were making the switch from \u0026ldquo;less popular\u0026rdquo; 8bit machines which were getting a bit long in the tooth to the ST and Amiga. The first two 16bit titles up were \u0026ldquo;Helter Skelter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Emlyn Hughes International Soccer\u0026rdquo;. The highly regarded Binary Design team had been commissioned to produce a big game for Christmas, but there were no details. Activision was readying a batch of ports of \u0026ldquo;R-Type\u0026rdquo; for home computers. Like with many ports they all varied in quality and content. Gremlin were finishing up a game in which you play a TRex trying to retrieve your stolen eggs, which results in destroying much of Japan. The game was previewed as \u0026ldquo;T-Wrecks\u0026rdquo; but ended up being released as \u0026ldquo;The Muncher\u0026rdquo; as part of a Chewits production. Mastertronic signed a deal with Psygnosis to bring \u0026ldquo;Barbarian\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Terrorpods\u0026rdquo; to 8bit machines. An ambitious task to say the least. After the success of the original, Rainbow Arts were busy on a sequel to Giana Sisters titled \u0026ldquo;Arthur and Marthur: Giana Twins In Future World\u0026rdquo;. By the looks of this it never made it out, presumably due to the the lawsuits from Nintendo. Microprose had almost finished \u0026ldquo;Red Storm Rising\u0026rdquo; - an arcade strategy epic based on Clancy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Hunt for Red October\u0026rdquo;. There was a more in depth preview of \u0026ldquo;The Kristal\u0026rdquo; - the game that originally started off as a stage musical. The game\u0026rsquo;s director claimed it would be \u0026ldquo;the biggest game ever!\u0026rdquo;. It didn\u0026rsquo;t really live up to the hype..

Aside from a couple of heartwarming tales of people finding love, there were the concerns of the proliferation of obscene material, hate speech, weapon trading/making and people just being complete dicks. There had been calls to increase monitoring, but it was becoming more and more difficult as the number of people using the services grew. The more things change\u0026hellip; The implications of the new CD-ROM technology were examined. It seemed unlikely that consoles or personal computers would be harnessing CD drives any time soon as they just didn\u0026rsquo;t have the RAM to make it worthwhile. At that point even streaming video was out of the question due to the slow data rates and lack of grunt to handle decent compression. TGM spoke to Rare about the PC Engine, which was due for release in Britain. Rare had taken delivery of a unit in December and had had some people working on it. The overall impression was very good, but Chris Stamper pointed out that they were still committed to Nintendo (and indeed that commitment remained until Microsoft bought them). Marshal M Rosenthal visited the CN Tower in Toronto to check out the \u0026ldquo;Tour of the Universe\u0026rdquo; experience. The show made use of 70mm large format film at 60fps, hydraulics, and a sophisticated sound system to - apparently - impressive effect. The proliferation of new labels (i.e. existing publishers creating new labels for specific markets) was examined. The fact that it was still perfectly possible for entirely new publishers to be successful was mentioned, though it came with a warning: \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, as industries mature their veins grow taught and it becomes increasingly difficult for newcomers to break into the business. So, if you hanker after starting your own software label, now might well be the best time.\u0026rdquo; The names of hardware and software companies, along with games were put under the microscope in a rather silly piece. One amusing bit: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Top Ten Hits\u0026rsquo; is probably the worst software house name around because it\u0026rsquo;s so transparent, and \u0026lsquo;Code Masters\u0026rsquo; comes a close second.\u0026rdquo; Mel Croucher gave a round up of his suggestions for which camcorder to buy.

I absolutely loved this game. \u0026ldquo;Mercenary\u0026rdquo; Novagen - Speaking of excited previewers, I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone could be more excited for a game than the person that wrote this preview. \u0026ldquo;Visually this game is truly stunning - air-sick bags at the ready!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Playing this game is so exhilarating!\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;A-mazing!\u0026rdquo;. All justified of course as it turned out to be brilliant. Notable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Knight Lore\u0026rdquo; Ultimate - Blitz Game Amstrad 9/10 BBC 10/10. Both reviews strangely dismissive of the game, despite the high score. The Amstrad one poured some scorn on Ultimate\u0026rsquo;s games in general.

It was an attempt to bring \u0026ldquo;computer art\u0026rdquo; into the mainstream - not just graphics, but works using fabric etc. Elsewhere, Carnegie Mellon began a course on writing \u0026ldquo;interactive fiction.\u0026rdquo; CRL\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Wolfman\u0026rdquo; was in the news for failing to be slapped with a British Board of Censors rating certificate, unlike their previous adventures. This was apparently due to the game having \u0026ldquo;less animated\u0026rdquo; questionable material (animated being the key thing). Palace Software announced a sequel to \u0026ldquo;Barbarian\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;Barbarian - The Dungeon of Drax\u0026rdquo;. Also in the article was a mention that \u0026ldquo;Vixen\u0026rdquo; from Martech was about to be released (if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering what the connection was, it was the covers. Notable Previews # Hewson announced their first foray onto the 16bits - a port of \u0026ldquo;Zynaps\u0026rdquo;. They also had a couple of 8bit games on the way: \u0026ldquo;Marauder\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Netherworld\u0026rdquo;. There was mention of two other games - \u0026ldquo;Roadstar XRi\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Azimodious - Angel of Death\u0026rdquo; - but I don\u0026rsquo;t think they ever saw the light of day. Meanwhile there was speculation as to what Raffaele Cecco had up his sleeve for Christmas. \u0026ldquo;The Last Ninja II\u0026rdquo; was nearing release, after a reported \u0026ldquo;8,000 man-hours of development and planning\u0026rdquo;. Ocean had a couple of new coin-op conversions: \u0026ldquo;Operation Wolf\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Typhoon\u0026rdquo;. Hard to believe it took so long to get a sequel, but \u0026ldquo;Football Manager II\u0026rdquo; by Addictive was about to be released. Speaking of which, Kevin Toms has been beavering away on a spanking brand new version for iOS. The infamous \u0026ldquo;Great Giana Sisters\u0026rdquo; had its release date set for July. This rather excellent game was soon pulled from the shelves after legal action by Nintendo. Magnetic Scrolls\u0026rsquo; latest - \u0026ldquo;Corruption\u0026rdquo; - was due to hit shelves in June. I have very fond memories playing this. The game that was the poster child for the Archimedes, \u0026ldquo;Zarch\u0026rdquo;, was finally coming to the Amiga and ST (under the name \u0026ldquo;Virus\u0026rdquo;). Features # Mel Croucher interviewed several industry folk on what things (specifically Big Brother related) would be like in 2001. Some quite amusing, slightly bonkers responses about government surveillance but, well, they weren\u0026rsquo;t too far off, were they? To accompany Croucher\u0026rsquo;s look at the dark side of technology, there was a look at what games and game development might resemble in 2001. Lots of talk of RISC, parallel processing, transputers, realistic AI and so on. These articles always seem quaintly naive in retrospect, but it makes you appreciate how far you\u0026rsquo;ve come - and who knows what awaits in the near future. Remember that back then there was no publicly accessible Internet, and even laptops that you could use on your lap seemed like science fiction. Perhaps the most interesting theme of the piece for me was: technology isn\u0026rsquo;t entertainment. Continuing the whole \u0026ldquo;The Future!\u0026rdquo; theme, TGM went to the Ideal Home Exhibition to see the \u0026ldquo;Vision 2020 Home of the Future.\u0026rdquo; It was all rather silly. To round off this peek into the future, Mel Croucher went over the history of sound in games, and had some thoughts on what was in store. The MSX-II had recently launched and the options (one from Sony and one from Philips) were examined. Promising, but never went anywhere in the West. There was a \u0026ldquo;hard hitting\u0026rdquo; investigation into the alleged practice of software houses deliberately supplying pirates of games before they were released. Somewhat bizarrely, apart from the introduction, there was absolutely no further mention of this deliberate supply, but just that some developers were getting access to leaks from other companies to see what the competition was up to. Notable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Carrier Command\u0026rdquo; Realtime/Rainbird - ST 98% \u0026ldquo;Carrier Command is a seminal game destined to change the state of software and, as such, ranks alongside programs as Elite, Knight Lore, Flight Simulator 2 and The Hobbit\u0026hellip; In short, Rainbird have done it again, bringing us masterpiece of coding which will almost certainly be THE game of the year.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Target Renegade\u0026rdquo; Imagine - Spectrum 85% \u0026ldquo;A distinct improvement over the original, the Spectrum game is a very good sequel - and tough - indeed.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Karnov\u0026rdquo; Electric Dreams - Spectrum 88% \u0026ldquo;Should prove popular, with stacks of lasting appeal in nine tortuous levels and addictive action.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Wizball\u0026rdquo; Ocean - ST 87% Amiga 84% \u0026ldquo;Although the games\u0026rsquo; structures remains identical to their 8-bit cousin, the ST and Amiga conversions have lost the fun element.\u0026rdquo; Too true - easily one of my biggest gaming disappointments.

The Games Machine '88"},{"content":" News #On the back of the news that the price of the Spectrum 128K had dropped following the acquisition by Amstrad, rumours started to circulate that a 256K \u0026ldquo;games machine\u0026rdquo; was in the pipeline. According to the rumours the machine would be Spectrum based but would use credit card sized \u0026ldquo;cartridges\u0026rdquo;. Reactions were mixed - while this would drastically reduce piracy, software houses feared Amstrad having control over what games would be released. During the announcement of the Amstrad takeover of Sinclair, Alan Sugar suggested that they may introduce an \u0026ldquo;approval process\u0026rdquo; for the regular Spectrum to try to lessen software incompatibility between hardware revisions.\nVirgin Games and New Generation Games signed a deal to give Virgin rights to the whole New Generation back catalogue. Meanwhile, Virgin purchased Leisure Genius - the developer behind several successful adaptations of popular board games.\nClem Chambers of CRL was in a bit of hot water after trying to launch a scheme where classified ads were placed to try to recruit kids at school to sell CRL\u0026rsquo;s games on commission. Clem said, \u0026ldquo;Anyone would have thought I was trying to sell heroin.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Consumer Electronics Show held in London was described as being \u0026ldquo;the pits\u0026rdquo; as no home computer companies and only a handful of game software houses showed up. Not only was the show lacking in interesting companies, but also attendees - so much so that the organisers pondered opening it up to the general public.\nFirebird signed a deal with Level 9 which would see revamped versions of several adventures released on the budget label in the UK and the US. Level 9 also announced a new adventure \u0026ldquo;Knight Orc\u0026rdquo; and said that they had pretty much wrapped up the much anticipated \u0026ldquo;The Price of Magik\u0026rdquo;.\nNotable Reviews # \u0026ldquo;Spindizzy\u0026rdquo; Paul Shirley \u0026amp; Phil Churchyard/Electric Dreams - Crash Smash 93% \u0026ldquo;A very neat game - a very neat variant on the maze/mapping theme, brilliantly done.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Knight Tyme\u0026rdquo; David Jones/Mastertronic - 128K Crash Smash 94% \u0026ldquo;Another excellent adventure from David Jones.

The winner (aka The Designer) would spend time with Design Design and Crash throughout development, and Domark would let them in on \u0026ldquo;some of the secrets\u0026rdquo; of publishing - they would even get taken to the tape duplication factory to witness it take physical form. As if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough, the winner would also get 10% of the royalties (a minimum of Â£1000). A winner would be chosen in two months and the game would be on the shelves in time for Christmas. This was pretty much a dream competition. Accompanying the competition announcement was a feature where Graham Stafford from Design Design gave a condensed guide to designing games. Some choice quotes: \u0026ldquo;Remember, across the whole spectrum of decisions you must make: a good original idea is usually much better than an old one.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;there are two major restrictions to game design that apply when dealing with any computer: available memory size and speed\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;try not to limit your horizons too much, but don\u0026rsquo;t go silly.\u0026rdquo; regarding graphics: \u0026ldquo;A very important part of a game these days, some would say unfortunately big, so time spent here is worthwhile.\u0026rdquo; Interview with Realtime who had just released the excellent \u0026ldquo;Starstrike II\u0026rdquo;. They were unsure if any more could be squeezed out of the Spectrum, but then they would go onto port \u0026ldquo;Carrier Command\u0026rdquo; which was an impressive feat. Graeme Kidd took a look at the ever increasing number of cheap compilations. Crash put out a call for readers to submit any \u0026ldquo;homegrown\u0026rdquo; games that people would like reviewed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not easy to break into selling your own software today - and with the advent of large companies who work to commercial margins there\u0026rsquo;s almost certainly quite a few decent programs out there that only get sold to friends, relatives and people in the street.\u0026rdquo; A new regular feature began called \u0026ldquo;On the screen\u0026rdquo; where readers could send in pictures they created on their Spectrums.

According to the site, not only is Deus Ex Machina 2 on the way, but also remakes of PiMania and even Thanatos. The latter is interesting seeing as I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure Croucher had nothing to do with the original.\nThe original Deus Ex Machina was quite easily one of the most incredible game experiences I had during that time. I still occasionally listen to the soundtrack to this day (voiced by the likes of Ian Dury, Jon Pertwee, Donna Bailey and Frankie Howerd). It really was a remarkable work and completely unlike anything then or since. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell how close the sequel is to release - apparently Spring 2013. The soundtrack has been produced and is available to buy, but the footage of the game itself looks very ropey - it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since the trailer was made, so I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it\u0026rsquo;s come along somewhat since then.\nI must admit I never played PiMania, though I was quite intrigued by the surrounding antics. Automata had hidden a Golden Sundial somewhere in England and anyone who actually managed to complete the game would get a clue as to its whereabouts. It took 3 years to be found, and it\u0026rsquo;s no wonder when you consider what was required to figure it out.

For a start they produced some great adventures games - \u0026ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure\u0026rdquo; was my first exposure to them, which I remember fondly. Their games were known for being well written with a keen sense of humour. Then there was the fact that they appeared to be a company consisting entirely of women (quite unique in the industry), as they were generally referred to as \u0026ldquo;the sisters\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;the ladies\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;the belles\u0026rdquo;/etc of St Brides (to what extent this was actually the case, I\u0026rsquo;m unsure).\nBut then there was this:\nGames Lessons (Crash 26)\nand this:\nBack to School (Sinclair User 45)\nBeing a naive schoolboy, I just assumed it was some kind of rather impressive marketing schtick - it certainly set them apart from other developers at the time.

Even so, how could one not be intrigued?\nThe last game of theirs I played was \u0026ldquo;Bugsy\u0026rdquo; which was released in 1986. I knew they were involved in the highly controversial \u0026ldquo;Jack the Ripper\u0026rdquo; which gained national attention in 1987 when tabloids ran headlines like \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;Porno\u0026rsquo; outrage at Ripper game\u0026rdquo; and MPs tried to have it banned. I thought Ripper was their last game, but it looks like they released two further adventures in 1992 (1992 would be a significant year for the ladies of St Brides). After that they seemed to disappear entirely.\nEvery now and then I sit down and spend some time Googling people like Paul Woakes (Novagen), Roy Carter \u0026amp; Greg Follis (Gargoyle Games), Mervyn J Estcourt, and, of course, St Brides to see if I can find any information about what happened to them. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten used to coming up empty handed, but this time I did have some luck with regards to St Brides.\nI stumbled across this newspaper article from 1993, and a slightly more recent piece from 1995.\nMore articles can be found on this site dedicated to Aristasia, and there\u0026rsquo;s also a Wikipedia entry for the mysterious Miss Martindale.\nSo there you go, that\u0026rsquo;s what happened to the girls of St Brides.\n","date":"23 April 2013","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2013/4/23/st-brides/","section":"","summary":"","title":"St Brides"},{"content":" Compared to the previous few months, there seemed like a relative dearth of good games released for the Spectrum. Crash pondered whether this had anything to do with the recent release of the Spectrum 128K. Game compilations (often tied to a charity) were coming out at a ridiculous rate - would this result in the cost of games for the consumer (typically kids) going down? or will the revenue developers see take a big hit as people choose cheap compilations over \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; release games?\nThe InDin industry event had taken place just before Christmas. \u0026ldquo;Little Computer People\u0026rdquo; (C64) from Activision won the award for \u0026ldquo;The Best Alternative Software\u0026rdquo;. The InDin was still being held when I started working in games in London in the mid 90s\u0026hellip; looks like it may have been another victim of the decimation of the UK industry.\nIn an interesting move, Crash got Julian Rignall (from Zzap!64) in to look over a few games that took advantage of the new 128K hardware. The games were:\n\u0026ldquo;Daley Thompson\u0026rsquo;s Supertest\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Neverending Story\u0026rdquo; from Ocean \u0026ldquo;Technician Ted - the Megamix\u0026rdquo; from Hewson \u0026ldquo;Sweevo\u0026rsquo;s Whirled\u0026rdquo; from Gargoyle Games \u0026ldquo;Robin of the Wood\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Nodes of Yesod\u0026rdquo; from Odin \u0026ldquo;Three Weeks in Paradise\u0026rdquo; from Mikro-Gen \u0026ldquo;Gladiator\u0026rdquo; from Domark There was a \u0026ldquo;Back Backlash\u0026rdquo; from readers in the letters section, with people writing in to complain about people who had previously written in to complain about the sometimes violent (e.g. Friday the 13th) or sexual (e.g. Dun Darach) covers.\nInterviews # Palace Software, who were working on followups to \u0026ldquo;Cauldron\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Sacred Armour of Antiriad\u0026rdquo; MC Lothlorien, who were well regarded for their strategy wargames. A great interview with Mel Croucher about his upcoming game ID, life after the PiMan, and the state of the games industry. Croucher complained that the trend in games was for developers to shy away from creative products as they focussed what technical wizadry the programmers could deliver. The obsession with arcade ports and software houses clamouring for arcade port rights were the most obvious sign of this. Not only that, when a company would release something new and fresh, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the clones to appear - often technically superior in some way with a much bigger marketing budget. Croucher lamented the loss of small independent software houses due to the arrival of large, powerful publishers. He was tired of games where the goal of the player was to kill people, believing that games had a lot more to contribute to society. It really is a great interview and it shows just how far ahead of the time he was. David Ward and Colin Stokes from Ocean, on life after the dramatic demise of Imagine.

Crash '86"},{"content":"postimage screenlg2.jpg\nWhen I finally got around to picking up a 360 a couple of years ago, the first thing I did when I set it up was download Sensible World Of Soccer (SWOS). Forget Halo, or Gears of War, or Mass Effect; SWOS was what I cared about. The Amiga version is the game I routinely tell people is \u0026ldquo;the best game ever made\u0026rdquo; and I played it everyday for years during the 90s. While people may scoff at rating a football game so highly, I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not the only one#Awards).\nMy first impressions of this new XBLA version were good - the music and graphics had been updated, but in a restrained way that kept the original feel. I started a game and it all looked so familiar but\u0026hellip; I sucked. Never mind, I thought - I was bound to be a bit rusty. But after an hour I decided that I really did suck. Disappointed I quit the game and moved onto something else.\nThen recently I figured it was time to give it another shot, but actually put some proper effort into it. Sadly I didn\u0026rsquo;t fair much better. I think the main problem was that I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t pull off aftertouch reliably, and aftertouch is perhaps the key to SWOS. It occurred to me that it might be something to do with the controller (a bad workman\u0026hellip;) and after a few days of this bugging me I ordered a MadCatz SoulCalibur V Arcade FightStick Soul Edition. Despite the silly name, it\u0026rsquo;s actually a rather good controller. It feels solid and sits comfortably in ones lap. The controls themselves are responsive, but if I had one complaint it\u0026rsquo;d be that I\u0026rsquo;d like more resistance - I find it too easy to trigger a button press or a direction change.\nMy first couple of games weren\u0026rsquo;t a whole lot better than before, but then suddenly I found myself curling the ball with reasonable confidence. This was the game I remembered. The beauty of SWOS is that the only controls are the 8 directions of stick and one button. Yes, one button controls passing, shooting, sliding, heading the ball and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s a masterpiece of controls design. I\u0026rsquo;m still a bit frustrated with what seems to be occasional missed button presses (something I\u0026rsquo;m sure I also noticed when playing with the regular Xbox controller), but that may be my imagination. Buying an expensive controller for the sake of a reasonably old XBLA game may seem crazy, but for me it\u0026rsquo;s like having an old friend back and I\u0026rsquo;m delighted.\n","date":"13 April 2013","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2013/4/14/sensible-world-of-soccer-xbla/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Sensible World of Soccer (XBLA)"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/tags/xbla/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"XBLA"},{"content":"postimage bedrooms_to_billions.jpg\nAfter a successful round of crowdfunding last year, the people behind the \u0026ldquo;From Bedrooms to Billions\u0026rdquo; documentary and conducting a new Kickstarter campaign in order to cover the myriad of costs involved in finishing and polishing the film.

Last week the consistently excellent iOS developer Simogo released their latest game, \u0026ldquo;Year Walk\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a highly atmospheric affair, rather beautiful yet sinister, that references various Swedish folk tales (the \u0026ldquo;Year Walk\u0026rdquo; itself being an old tradition). After a brief setup, the player is placed in a snowy landscape with no instructions on what to do - the game is all about letting the player discover everything for themselves. Simogo have done a great job to make this discovery a natural, intuitive thing to do. The puzzles were enjoyable and the game never made me feel stupid\u0026hellip; well, apart from one particular bit where I knew there was something I had to interact with (so not a puzzle as such), but took me a long time to find it. But that was the only moment of frustration I felt.

I certainly remember playing it, but I also remember not really knowing what I was doing. It\u0026rsquo;s somewhat reminiscent of The Sentinel (surely a remake of that must be on the cards?), and features 9999 procedurally generated levels.\nThe original scored well in magazines of the day (Zzap! gave it 90%) and the remake is a decent job, though it feels a little rough and finicky - it seems to be a pretty straightforward port of the modern desktop version and the touch controls could use some love. With that said, it\u0026rsquo;s enjoyable and even features the original music by David Whittaker.\n","date":"20 February 2013","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/news/2013/2/20/archipelagos-ios/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Archipelagos (iOS)"},{"content":"Computer \u0026amp; Video Games #1985 # May June July August September October November December 1986 # January March April May June July August September October November December 1987 # January February March April May June July August September October November December 1988 # January February March April May June July August September October November December 1989 # January February March May June July August September October November December 1990 # February ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/cvg/","section":"Welcome to Ziggurat","summary":"","title":"C\u0026VG"},{"content":"Crash! #1986 # April May June September October November December 1987 # January February March April May June ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/crash/","section":"Welcome to Ziggurat","summary":"","title":"Crash!"},{"content":"The Games Machine #1988 # April May June July August September October November December 1989 # January February March ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/the-games-machine/","section":"Welcome to Ziggurat","summary":"","title":"The Games Machine"},{"content":"The One Amiga #1991 # August October 1992 # March April May June July August September October November ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/the-one-amiga/","section":"Welcome to Ziggurat","summary":"","title":"The One Amiga"},{"content":"Zzap!64 #1986 # February March April May June July August September October November December 1987 # January February March April May June July August September October November December 1988 # January February March April May June July August ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"https://ziggurat.co.nz/zzap64/","section":"Welcome to Ziggurat","summary":"","title":"ZZap!64"}]
