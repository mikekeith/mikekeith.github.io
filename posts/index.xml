      <title>A Sudden Change of Plans</title>

The quotes indicating that I haven&amp;rsquo;t quite decided what form it will take.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quitting had been on my mind for a while, in that typically vague wishy washy &amp;ldquo;oh, I dunno - sometime in the future&amp;rdquo; way, but a surprise decision by company execs to pursue a business partnership I felt was deeply unethical and problematic suddenly brought the need to make a change front and centre with a real jolt. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie - I have zero regrets and feel so much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid&#xA;was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought&#xA;out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Retailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a&#xA;new CD32 bundle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The specs included &amp;ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive,&#xA;32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&amp;rdquo;. And of course&#xA;it was The One&amp;rsquo;s April Fools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only &amp;ldquo;big names&amp;rdquo;&#xA;attached to it were Christopher Lambert and Talisa Soto (a Bond girl in&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Licence to Kill&amp;rdquo;). Unknown Paul Anderson was to direct. Elsewhere there were&#xA;rumours of movies based on &amp;ldquo;Doom&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Myst&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The end did seem in sight (something that had&#xA;been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI&#xA;remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the&#xA;lack of new stock. With that said, apparently 82% of stores surveyed were keen&#xA;to continue selling the machines (if they were provided some to sell&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t without its price, tho: &amp;ldquo;So, it&amp;rsquo;s taken&#xA;us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and&#xA;getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fate of Commodore remained up in the air, with little news to be had. The&#xA;only new development of interest being that US-based Creative Equipment&#xA;International had put up a $1 million deposit as a first step towards an&#xA;acquisition. Commodore UK&amp;rsquo;s team remained the main other contender.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was to be a “buying&#xA;show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but&#xA;The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left to purchase by then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the US head office Mehdi Ali&#xA;was officially out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I just checked when the last instalment of this was, thinking it had&#xA;to have been mid-2019, but instead it was in fact in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/news/2019/2/24/diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs&#34;&gt;February 2019&lt;/a&gt; 😱&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wha’ happen? Well, work was crazy busy throughout most of last year. I managed&#xA;to squeeze in a lovely holiday trip back to London, after which it was&#xA;straight on a plane to spend 2-3 weeks with the Sunnyvale office (and when I&#xA;say “straight on a plane” I mean I literally had 1 day at home after the&#xA;gruelling journey back from London before flying out). The rest of 2019 was a&#xA;bit of blur, mainly due to work. Then things got proper surreal in March with&#xA;Covid, lockdown and, well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/news/2020/5/7/well-that-was-quite-a-ride&#34;&gt;being laid off&lt;/a&gt; a short time into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It seemed everything was hanging on that&#xA;deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &amp;ldquo;Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last&#xA;year. The market value in 1993 was £670 million compared to £700 million in&#xA;1992. One theory was falling software prices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The &amp;ldquo;most solid&amp;rdquo;&#xA;information pointed to a &amp;ldquo;Far-Eastern&amp;rdquo; company, with Acer, Samsung and&#xA;Goldstar all rumoured to be in the running. While the UK office had continued&#xA;trading, they weren&amp;rsquo;t receiving any new units to sell which meant they had to&#xA;make do with whatever stock they had in their warehouses. The One was putting&#xA;on a brave face: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s pretty unthinkable that a company which can sell&#xA;150,000 machines at £299 each in a year (the Amiga 1200, in other words) will&#xA;be simply wiped out. Expect good news soon.&amp;rdquo; Hmm yeah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the&#xA;last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move&#xA;was obviously concerning, The One were confident that the continued popularity&#xA;of the Amiga would mean a positive outcome one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Voyage pack included &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1604&#34;&gt;“Microcosm”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=571&#34;&gt;“The Chaos&#xA;Engine”&lt;/a&gt;, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks&#xA;lasted, all for £299.99.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Codemasters were bringing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=229&#34;&gt;“Captain Dynamo”&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hol.abime.net/370&#34;&gt;“Dizzy CD&#xA;Collection”&lt;/a&gt; to the CD32. The latter would contain ten games on one CD&#xA;and cost £21.99. They were contemplating of also releasing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=743&#34;&gt;“Micro&#xA;Machines”&lt;/a&gt; and more on the console if sales were up to scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I made the decision to join Magic Leap back at the start of 2013, I told&#xA;my friends that I had no idea where it was going to lead, but I knew it would&#xA;be a ride&amp;hellip; and that it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s two weeks to the day that myself, my team here in NZ and over 1,000 of my&#xA;workmates at offices across the world were laid off. Well, technically those&#xA;of us in NZ entered into a &amp;ldquo;consultation&amp;rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by&#xA;NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant. It was a&#xA;sad end to what had been an intense (in good and bad ways) but incredible 7.5&#xA;years for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The lineup included &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215&#34;&gt;“Cannon Fodder”&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=354&#34;&gt;“Dune”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=355&#34;&gt;“Dune 2”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=616&#34;&gt;“Jimmy White’s Whirlwind Snooker”&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=82&#34;&gt;“Archer Maclean’s Pool”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=889&#34;&gt;“Realms”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=672&#34;&gt;“Legend of&#xA;Kyrandia”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1026&#34;&gt;“Supremacy”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=630&#34;&gt;“KGB”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2030&#34;&gt;“Reach for the&#xA;Skies”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2036&#34;&gt;“Shuttle”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=705&#34;&gt;“Lure of the Temptress”&lt;/a&gt;.

Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a&#xA;resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon&#xA;Byron was to take over the helm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1606&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, a&#xA;revamped version of their beat&amp;rsquo;em up featuring new AGA backdrops, digitised&#xA;speech and a digital CD soundtrack. They were also releasing two CD double&#xA;packs: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2035&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Project-X&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;F17 Challenge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=57&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien Breed Special&#xA;Edition&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=880&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Qwak&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. For those poor souls who were still stuck with&#xA;floppy disks, there was an eight disk compilation comprising of: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=183&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Body&#xA;Blows&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1023&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Superfrog&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Overdrive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(It didn&amp;rsquo;t happen)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming&#xA;World Cup, Virgin were keen to join with Adidas to sponsor a new initiative to&#xA;promote youth footballing skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mev Dinc and&#xA;his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and&#xA;illustration work be finished before a single line of code was written.. hmm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a&#xA;marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &amp;lsquo;93 exhibition and an&#xA;upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before&#xA;switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &amp;lsquo;93 was&#xA;such a big hit that Commodore had already booked its presence at next year&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;event. At this stage there was around 15 titles available for the console with&#xA;25 more due in the next &amp;ldquo;couple of months&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Team 17&#xA;and Sensible Software won Software House of the Year and Computer Game of the&#xA;Year respectively, with Jon Hare giving a &amp;ldquo;stirring speech warning against the&#xA;dangers of complacency.&amp;rdquo; The Amiga related winners were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Software House of the Year: Team 17&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computer Game of the Year: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=941&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Sensible Software&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Best Licensed Computer Game: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=558&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; LucasArts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Programming Team of the Year: LucasArts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Best Computer Simulation: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=389&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Formula One Grand Prix&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Geoff Crammond/Microprose&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Team 17 announced two new titles, both racing games: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Overdrive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;F1 Challenge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (the latter would be renamed to &amp;ldquo;F17 Challenge&amp;rdquo; after some legal issues). They had also signed Jose Doran and Richard Heasman who were working on a game code named &amp;ldquo;Little Sod&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Lots of humour is promised, as the game will present its player with 99 ways to splat an inoffensive little blue blob.&amp;rdquo; I have no idea if that ever saw the light of day. Martyn Brown also teased a future project with a Swedish developer who was known for pinball&amp;hellip; So obviously Digitial Illusions, but did anything actually come of this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It transpired that his involvement&#xA;came about after he contacted The One to complain they&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to credit&#xA;him for &amp;ldquo;Watchmen&amp;rdquo;. The mag decided to lend him an Amiga and a copy of &amp;ldquo;Deluxe&#xA;Paint&amp;rdquo; for a followup article, which sparked his interest in computer art and&#xA;lead to an introduction to Cecil. The game was due out during the Summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diary of a Game: Part 4 - Item Activation, Interpolation and... Bugs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my last update work has been a bit quieter post-ship and I enjoyed an&#xA;unexpectedly low key Christmas break, so surely I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress,&#xA;right? Well&amp;hellip; life decided to intervene which resulted in a lot less time to&#xA;work on the game than I had hoped. But I have managed to tick off a few things&#xA;on the long to-do list&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2019-02-24-2019224diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/image-asset.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;item-activation&#34;&gt;Item Activation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main - and, I must admit, only - playing facing addition is items that&#xA;need to be activated before they can be matched. Activation occurs when a&#xA;neighbour - regardless of colour - is matched and removed. I&amp;rsquo;ve reserved the&#xA;4th bit to indicate whether an item requires activation, which means I have 7&#xA;possible item types. So far I&amp;rsquo;m only using 4, so I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this will be&#xA;enough. However, I should be able to take the 5th bit to give 15 item types&#xA;(each with an unactivated variant) if need be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first up was a&#xA;&amp;ldquo;pseudo-sequel&amp;rdquo; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=377&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - called &amp;ldquo;Odyssey&amp;rdquo; - set 90 years further&#xA;in the future and would feature more of an open world feel. Sadly it looks&#xA;like it was never released.. The second was another sequel, jet fighter sim&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=394&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;TFX Inferno&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relative newcomer Miracle Games were rather bullish about their upcoming&#xA;platformer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hol.abime.net/5071&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Miracle Bat&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. They declared: &amp;ldquo;Miracle Bat is cooler than&#xA;Zool, harder than James Pond, faster than Sonic and the game is more complex&#xA;than any of Mario&amp;rsquo;s adventures&amp;rdquo; Ooo-ok then. Perhaps unsurprisingly it would&#xA;not see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This took a slightly&#xA;different twist on the original, with the goal being to re-unite twelve tribes&#xA;of Lemmings, each tribe having a different theme complete with their own&#xA;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An update to Sensi Software&amp;rsquo;s smash hit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=939&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had arrived&#xA;and boasted a bevy of new and improved features, including red &amp;amp; yellow cards,&#xA;the back pass rule and more competent goalies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interplay opened up an office in London and had plans to handle the publishing&#xA;of their games in the US themselves, rather than going through EA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While the&#xA;earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one&#xA;would be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much&#xA;targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming&#xA;machine and right as the mag went to press it looked like they had news&amp;hellip;&#xA;though that would have to wait until next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Would it be able to take back the crown from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=941&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn&amp;rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=939&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was due out next month. Player and club data&#xA;had been updated for the new season, and there were other welcome changes such&#xA;as re-written goalie behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good grief, in my mind my last update was 3, maybe 4, months ago&amp;hellip; but May?!&#xA;Well, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;a href=&#34;https://michael-keith-y85g.squarespace.com/news/2018/10/15/of-magic-leap-amp-dr-grordborts&#34;&gt;a decent excuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite being embarassingly tardy with writing updates, some progress has been&#xA;made. This is the current state of the game:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2018-10-15-20181015diary-of-a-game-part-3-sprites-character-animation-and-input/20181015.2018-10-15-10_54_13.gif&#34; alt=&#34;20181015.2018-10-15 10_54_13.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sprites&#34;&gt;Sprites&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to stick with the C64&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Standard_Character_Mode&#34;&gt;standard character mode&lt;/a&gt; - I&#xA;may well switch to the multicolour character mode, but a character approach&#xA;seems to be working well. In order to draw the overlapping rows of items on&#xA;the board, I just change the horizontal scroll value every 8 lines which means&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to faff about with creating a bunch of extra in-between chars.&#xA;The downside to this is that as items/balls/whatever fall down, they jump left&#xA;and right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Workshop was well known, especially here in NZ, but there was little to&#xA;no info out there about the latter. Nevertheless it sounded intriguing and I&#xA;figured why not.. I was the first and - for 6 months - only programmer on the&#xA;project which would grow and transform over the coming years into &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20191026214025/https://www.magicleap.com/experiences/invaders&#34;&gt;Dr&#xA;Grordbort&amp;rsquo;s Invaders&lt;/a&gt;. I was also the first games industry person at&#xA;Magic Leap. Quite amazing to think how far things have come since those early&#xA;days. The NZ studio has grown to around 50 people, and my job entails very&#xA;little programming these days - we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to hire a bunch of far&#xA;more talented people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit&#xA;between the A600 and the A1500. Commodore&amp;rsquo;s Market Director Kelly Sumner was&#xA;adamant there would be no machine called the A800, but did confirm there was&#xA;another machine on the way&amp;hellip; I assume it was the A1200.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=118&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barbarian&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=121&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2303&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shoot&amp;rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&amp;rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &lt;a href=&#34;http://hol.abime.net/739&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hostile Breed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (unreleased, but was actually finished and reviewed two issues earlier), and &amp;ldquo;Super Barbarian&amp;rdquo; (also unreleased).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After the world had lived in fear of nuclear annihalation for so many&#xA;years, the arrival of the likes of Gorbachev meant we could now focus on the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;prospect of irreversible doom&amp;rdquo; thanks to global warming. Technology would, of&#xA;course, play a significant role in what was to come: &amp;ldquo;Our ability to&#xA;manipulate information and communicate the results to the whole World within&#xA;seconds, could lead us into chaos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The One for Amiga was now just &amp;ldquo;The One&amp;rdquo; as&#xA;the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the&#xA;scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in&#xA;favour of &amp;ldquo;special interviews&amp;rdquo; because the latter was &amp;ldquo;simply more&#xA;interesting&amp;rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may have&#xA;gone a little easy on games). Jim Douglas was the new editor, and Gary Whitta&#xA;returned as staff writer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again a depressing amount of time has passed since my last update. Given&#xA;what&amp;rsquo;s on my plate workwise over the next few months I suspect the sporadic&#xA;nature of my posts will continue. Thankfully I have continued to find time to&#xA;chip away at the game, and some progress has been made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I managed to get a super rough first pass of the (very) initial base of&#xA;the game done (with the balls/bubbles/whatever falling down the board and&#xA;stacking up correctly), the next thing to tackle was the colour matching. This&#xA;ended up being a rather humbling endeavour as my initial confidence met the&#xA;realities of my inexperience with 6502 coding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;reason enough to back it, there&amp;rsquo;s the return of the White Wizard adventure&#xA;section (including an interview with Scott Adams), Simon Butler casting his&#xA;over C64 fan art, Paul Rand on a day in the life of producing Zzap!64 back in&#xA;the day, and perhaps most interestingly, a gathering of old school legends&#xA;(Andrew Braybrook and Archer Maclean were mentioned) reminiscing about the C64&#xA;over a pint. The articles that have stuck in my mind from when I was a regular&#xA;Zzap!64 reader were where they gathered a few industry greats to shoot the&#xA;breeze (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/zzap64-magazine-016#page/40&#34;&gt;The Musicians Ball&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Such a drastic&#xA;move must&amp;rsquo;ve been a bitter pill to swallow, but it did mean the return of Gary&#xA;Whitta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during its first season.&#xA;While there had been no official confirmation, it looked likely to return.&#xA;Yorkshire Television were producing a show with Andy Crane that was &amp;ldquo;more&#xA;Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s World than Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo;, and the BBC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;100 Per Cent&amp;rdquo; and ITV&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Video View&amp;rdquo; were apparently adding gaming content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Back in the 8 and 16 bit days I would often pour my disdain on&#xA;these games while proclaiming the superiority of the good old text adventure.&#xA;I was willing to accept the static images that accompanied games like &lt;a href=&#34;https://strandgames.com/games/theguild&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The&#xA;Guild of Thieves&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006023&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Boggit&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, but controlling a pixeled&#xA;character and clicking on things with a limited set of verbs? Leave it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I actually found a copy of this in a&#xA;local bookstore around 2000 - completely random.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this&#xA;series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I&#xA;knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but&#xA;what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another,&#xA;longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a&#xA;single weekend. Work-wise it was a very productive and beneficial time, but it&#xA;did mean that other things slipped through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The package included a computer interface to connect your regular CD&#xA;player and the CD-ROM containing 30 Code Masters games. The Spectrum version&#xA;was able to load games in under a minute, while the C64 utilised the stereo&#xA;audio signal to encode a timing track enabling even quicker load times. C&amp;amp;VG&#xA;marvelled at the possibilities: &amp;ldquo;Imagine a game with minutes of digitised&#xA;speech or amazing digitised graphics! It could happen.&amp;rdquo; Yes, indeed it could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wait,&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t walk away! It&amp;rsquo;ll get better, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various&#xA;points I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my&#xA;spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made&#xA;it through to the end and even that took way too long. The reasons for the&#xA;slow/non-existent progress have typically revolved around being swamped with&#xA;work, being overly ambitious and getting distracted by new shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve sunk quite a lot of hours&#xA;into attempting to diagnose the faults and finding replacement bits online,&#xA;with mixed success. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that I was eagerly awaiting&#xA;the release of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://icomp.de/shop-icomp/en/shop/product/c64-reloaded-mk2.html&#34;&gt;C64 Reloaded mk2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There looked to be some life left in the Amiga, but it was the IBM PC that stood the best chance of lasting. Perhaps the grimmest thing about this was the high entry bar for console development - what would happen to all the small UK devs?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In other not so happy news, the once great Infocom had been assimilated into Mediagenic (prev Activision). The office was moved to the West Coast, but it seemed no designers or developers relocated with it. Steve Meretzky and Dave Lebling were among the most recent to quit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An interview Level 9&amp;rsquo;s Pete Austin about their upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=931&#34;&gt;Scapeghost&lt;/a&gt;. He was rather coy about their plans beyond this one, but now that we have the benefit of hindsight and know that it in fact would be their last, it did seem like they saw the writing on the wall.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A look at &amp;ldquo;Ranch Wars&amp;rdquo; which was a Play By Mail game except it wasn&amp;rsquo;t - it was an &amp;ldquo;on-going graphic adventure that comes through the post&amp;rdquo; and was a &amp;ldquo;strange amalgam of interactive fiction, graphical war-gaming and strategy all mixed together&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Encyclopedia Frobbozzica - an indepth reference of all things Zork.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An interview with Joe Dever, author of the Lone Wolf books.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A look at Role Playing Play By Mail game &amp;ldquo;Calvana&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Was the icon driven Infogrames &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1766&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kult&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; the future of adventure games?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sandra Sharkey presented some general musings on writing adventures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Confidential went on a bit of LARPing with &amp;ldquo;Mythlore&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A short story by Ian Urquhart.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

I received both of&#xA;those during my Christmas school vacation and proceeded to spend many hours&#xA;figuring out my way through &amp;ldquo;Guild&amp;rdquo;. I even completed it without cheating&#xA;(well, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall ever seeing anything like a walkthrough, in those pre-&#xA;Internet days), which makes it quite a rarity for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, they certainly weren&amp;rsquo;t present on the day I visited.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The history of Sierra Online.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A piece pondering why it was that more women seemed to be designing, writing and playing adventures compared to other gaming genres. It was a bit silly and unsurprisingly feels dated, but did include comments from the likes of Anita Sinclair (Magnetic Scrolls) and Amy Biggs (Infocom).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A look at the &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s Murder&amp;rdquo; Play By Mail game.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A deep dive on the impressive lookign &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1257&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bloodwych&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which looked to marry &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=356&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dungeon Master&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=121&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Bards Tale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1539&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Archon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly the author had intended to call it &amp;ldquo;The Dungeonmaster&amp;rdquo; before FTL announced their game.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Infocom had been in decline for a little while, but now they were back with three big releases: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1366&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zork Zero&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=142&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Battlehawks - The Crescent Hawk&amp;rsquo;s Inception&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (the article kept referring to it as Battlehawks when it was in fact Battletech), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=609&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Journey&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3054&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shogun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Were they enough to raise Infocom back up to the top? The latter three games were examined in detail, and all three were interesting departures from (or, at least, tweaks to/re-imaginings of) the usual text adventure fare.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An interview with Infomedia who were busy working on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1383&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chronoquest 2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A write up of MOSAIC, a new concept for a &amp;ldquo;3rd generation adventure game&amp;rdquo; system, primarily aimed at Multi User Dungeons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A survey of the state of flight sims.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An &amp;ldquo;interview&amp;rdquo; with Larry Laffer (AKA, I assume, Al Lowe).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A short story sent in by reader David Holden.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

New custom chips meant it&#xA;could chuck around 128 sprites (up from 64) and the cartridges saw a decent&#xA;boost in size. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect was the Power Console add on&#xA;which the console slotted into and featured a full on steering yoke, a gear&#xA;stick/throttle, LCD clock/timer, LED radar display, numeric keypad and a bunch&#xA;of buttons and knobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the&#xA;UK on November 20th.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to release a couple of&#xA;compilations. Both would include&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2766&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uridium&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=596&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cybernoid II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2217&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sanxion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; being exclusive to the C64 and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002408&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hydrofool&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to&#xA;the Spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The line up of&#xA;Speccy developers is impressive, including the likes of my old boss Jon Ritman&#xA;and Bo Jangeborg. As someone who was obsessed by Delta4&amp;rsquo;s adventure games back&#xA;in the day, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly pleased to see Fergus McNeil in there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These documentaries are clearly a labour of love for Andy and I strongly&#xA;believe that we need to be capturing the stories of these pioneers, so I&#xA;really hope this funds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was a prolific musician who turned out some incredible tunes.&#xA;Seeing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=525&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Commando&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; at my mate&amp;rsquo;s place one afternoon after school helped&#xA;convince me I needed a C64. I remember going back to his house, tape recorder&#xA;in hand, to record the music to listen to on repeat (especially that lovely&#xA;game over tune). It sounds kind of crazy now, but I bought games purely&#xA;because they featured his music - and keep in mind, games weren&amp;rsquo;t cheap here&#xA;in NZ. I was most certainly not alone in doing this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not all of the eagerly anticipated&#xA;peripherals would be on sale to start with - the hydraulic chair was &amp;ldquo;on the&#xA;horizon&amp;rdquo; and expected to cost another 200 quid. Of course, sadly, none of this&#xA;was to be&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and&#xA;Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official&#xA;reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and&#xA;the asking price was rumoured to be around £5 million. The editorial&#xA;questioned the motives, highlighting a series of recent misteps resulting in&#xA;significant financial losses, which included the purchase of Beyond Software&#xA;(closed down soon after due to poor performance), and the US based Firebird&#xA;Licensees Inc which lasted less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On paper the specs weren&amp;rsquo;t up to much when compared to Nintendo and&#xA;Sega&amp;rsquo;s offerings, but at £69.95 it looked decent value for money. Stateside&#xA;the 7800 was the number 2 selling console ahead of the Master System.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spectravideo&amp;rsquo;s popular range of Quickshot joysticks (the Quickshot II Turbo&#xA;was my personal fave back in the day) was being joined by their new Wizmaster&#xA;gamepad. There were three varieties - one for the standard home computers, and&#xA;two for the NES (one of which was wireless via infrared). The price started at&#xA;£11.95.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The five were: Nick Walkind, Keith Campbell (C&amp;amp;VG, Commodore User), Mike Gerrard (Your Sinclair), Steve Cooke (ACE), Nik Wilde (Newsfield) and Kati Hamza (Zzap and Crash).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A look at MUD, including an exerpts from an interview with creator Richard Bartle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Keith Campbell examined the evolution of puzzles in adventure games.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Interview with Silicon Software, developers of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=673&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Legend of the Sword&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An &amp;ldquo;interview&amp;rdquo; with Level 9 chatacter Ingrid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An in depth piece on the new Advanced Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=852&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pool of Radiance&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A visit to play-by-mail specialists, KJC Games.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reveal of the new Magnetic Scrolls game, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2912&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Myth&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,that would be exclusively for club members.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A short story by Jane Rowe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A visit to The Crazy Dwarf in the Sussex Downs, one of the latest LARP groups to spring up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Michael Baywater pondered puzzles in games and life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Ciaran Brennan&#xA;was to take the reins, with Julian Rignall as his assistant. Phillipa Irving&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;war game section took a break as she was busy with exams. There was also a&#xA;small change to the review format, with the &amp;ldquo;Value&amp;rdquo; rating being dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arnie&amp;rsquo;s latest film &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1988&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Predator&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had grossed $12 million at the box&#xA;office in its first 3 days and Activision had signed the license.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Julian Rignall got to&#xA;check it out and was gobsmacked: &amp;ldquo;Erm&amp;hellip; hmmm&amp;hellip; What can I say about the most&#xA;exciting thing to happen to the games industry since the invention of the home&#xA;console?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sinclair (aka Amstrad) were to launch a new bundle. The &amp;ldquo;Action Pack&amp;rdquo; would&#xA;consist of a Spectrum +2 (£149) or +3 (£199), a Magnum light gun and 6 games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The line up of&#xA;other contributors is also looking rather impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crash holds a special place in my heart - it was my main go to mag back in the&#xA;day (before, I admit, I jumped ship to the C64&amp;hellip;), and I still have all the&#xA;well worn issues I used to pore over each month. So this was an instant back&#xA;for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this one for a while: &lt;a href=&#34;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/full-throttle-remastered/id1230257367?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v57p&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Full Throttle&#xA;Remastered&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; has been released for iOS. The iPad has become my adventure&#xA;gaming device of choice (aside from 8bit text adventures, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to&#xA;figure out a solution for that), so it&amp;rsquo;s great to see another LucasArts&#xA;classic on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but to coincide with the release Double Fine have slashed the&#xA;prices of &lt;a href=&#34;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/grim-fandango-remastered/id978524071?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v57p&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Grim Fandango Remastered&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered/id1114170869?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v57p&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Day of the Tentacle&#xA;Remastered&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - both highly recommended and absolute bargains at this&#xA;price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Others were expected to follow suit, though that did&#xA;seem somewhat unlikely as that’s a steep drop down from £9.95. Gary Penn&#xA;pondered how lower prices might affect the quality of games - lower budgets&#xA;for development? less licensed tie-ins? (The latter was considered a good&#xA;thing)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ciaran Brennan was promoted to Assistant Editor, and Gary Liddon was due to&#xA;make his return next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Graham Axten’s platformer, which starred&#xA;a rather charming bear, was looking great and was eagerly anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2017-07-14-2017714review-the-bear-essentials-c64-by-pondsoft/image-asset-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game draws heavily from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner&#34;&gt;Manic Miner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Willy&#34;&gt;Jet Set Willy&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;with a graphics style reminiscent of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=560&#34;&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt;. The influence of&#xA;Matthew Smith’s classic games is clear right from the start, where instead of&#xA;housekeeper Maria turning Willy away to go tidy the house after a massive&#xA;party, it’s Bear’s wife wanting enough apples to get the family through the&#xA;winter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a rather different approach, and requires the&#xA;user to install a few chips of their own in order to have a functioning C64.&#xA;The required chips are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CPU 6510 or 8500&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Two CIA 6526 or 8521&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Video chip 6567, 6569, 8565 or 8562&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SID 6581 and/or 8580&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The board supports a dual SID configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But, of course,&#xA;that&amp;rsquo;s not all - HDMI output and the full functionality of the Ulimate-II+ are&#xA;built in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Included in the game&amp;rsquo;s package was a&#xA;copy of &amp;ldquo;What Burglar?&amp;rdquo; magazine, and an advert for a mysterious&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Confidential&amp;rdquo; club. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s how I remember it - looking through the box&#xA;now I don&amp;rsquo;t see such an advert in there, though there is an offer to write in&#xA;to Magnetic Scrolls to receive some swag. Or maybe there was a card/form that&#xA;I filled out and posted. At any rate, I joined. This turned out to be the&#xA;Special Reserve mail order club founded by Tony Rainbird, and &amp;ldquo;Confidential&amp;rdquo;&#xA;was its magazine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The handheld had seen&#xA;a very successful launch in Japan with over 500,000 units being sold (300,000&#xA;of which were on the first day), and now the question was when would it reach&#xA;the UK. Nintendo were unable to give any dates, but confirmed they had plans…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The FIST telephone game was getting a sequel (I have no idea what this was).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The sequel to arguably one of the finest games of the&#xA;16bit era was cancelled late into its development and never saw the light of&#xA;day (aside from a leaked prototype ROM).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I missed out on the NES mini, mainly because I assumed that Nintendo would&#xA;keep on churning them out for a good while, so I&amp;rsquo;m much more tempted this time&#xA;around. No word from Nintendo Aus/NZ so far about a release date for here&#xA;[Update: NZ release is set for 30/09, which is the same day as elsewhere], but&#xA;hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll be in line with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the European leg we jaunted about in a campervan, staying at&#xA;campsites (and occasionally on roadsides) along the way. My memories of that&#xA;time are sadly vague - my main recollection is the ridiculously rough toilet&#xA;paper that one had to endure in the bathrooms. I’m talking really rough. Like&#xA;coarse sandpaper. I forget what town it was, but I actually kept a piece of it&#xA;in my jacket pocket to remind me of the horrors, and it was still intact when&#xA;we got home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Note the lack of “64” - Speccy, Atari, MSX and C16&#xA;gamers would all be catered for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Sensi Software lads were wrapping up their next game: the awesome&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2881&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wizball”&lt;/a&gt;. Interesting that the news snippet makes mention of a “do-&#xA;it-yourself” tune from Martin Galway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Coin ops and&#xA;consoles would get more pages, the adventure section got a make over, there&#xA;was more space dedicated to previews and overall there would be a lot more&#xA;colour. The announcement of these changes referenced the fact that some&#xA;features were dropped, but they didn’t actually specify which. Somewhat&#xA;worryingly, there were no adventure game reviews - just some tips. The&#xA;beginning of the end?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The return of Magnetic Scrolls? (Sort of)</title>

Hugh Steers - a founding member&#xA;of Magnetic Scrolls - has formed Strand Games along with Stefan Meier (from&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://msmemorial.if-legends.org/memorial.php&#34;&gt;if-legends.org&lt;/a&gt;). Their first release is a a remaster of the classic&#xA;adventure &lt;a href=&#34;https://strandgames.com/games/thepawn&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Pawn&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, available for &lt;a href=&#34;https://strandgames.itch.io/the-pawn-by-magnetic-scrolls&#34;&gt;Mac, Win and Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Not&#xA;only that, but they have the support of other Magnetic Scrolls alumni,&#xA;including Anita Sinclair and Ken Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across their site somewhat randomly - I&amp;rsquo;m a bit surprised it hasn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;received more coverage in the retro gaming scene. The funny thing is I had&#xA;recently been pondering whether a iOS interpreter for the Magnetic Scrolls&#xA;games would be an interesting project to take on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So I finally got around to picking up a few. From Psytronkik&#xA;there is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://binaryzone.org/retrostore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=2_18&amp;amp;products_id=200&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kung Fu Maniacs Trilogy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://binaryzone.org/retrostore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=2_18&amp;amp;products_id=201&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gravitrix&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://binaryzone.org/retrostore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=2_18&amp;amp;products_id=202&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;X-Force&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://binaryzone.org/retrostore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=2_18&amp;amp;products_id=305&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Space Trip 2086&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And one from Pond that I had been eagerly awaiting:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pondsoft.uk/bear.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Bear Essentials&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These should keep me busy for a little while&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The other people interviewed were my old Factor 5 colleagues Julian Eggebrecht, Jamie Uhrmacher and Chris Crawford, plus Ryan Kaufman who was a level designer at Lucasarts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I joined Factor 5 soon after &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron_(series)#Rogue_Squadron&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rogue Squadron&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had been released, and&#xA;my first game there would be the sadly underrated and somewhat unknown&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron_(series)#Episode_1:_Battle_for_Naboo&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Battle for Naboo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - the fact that it was an Episode 1 game right&#xA;after Star Wars fans worldwide had been punched in the guts by that terrible&#xA;movie didn&amp;rsquo;t help. However, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron_(series)#Rogue_Squadron_II:_Rogue_Leader&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rogue Leader&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that would prove to&#xA;be the highlight of the series, and perhaps the game I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of. The&#xA;third installment, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rogue_Squadron_(series)#Rogue_Squadron_III:_Rebel_Strike&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rebel Strike&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had a difficult development for a&#xA;number of reasons, some of which I touch on in the article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed&#xA;no signs of letting up. The mag would be undergoing a few changes - they&#xA;looked to be broadening the scope of what they were covering, including&#xA;“unusual, but relevant” features. This issue also saw the inclusion of a cover&#xA;tape which resulted in the price rising from a quid to £1.50.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, this is rather fascinating: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ebay.com/itm/Amiga-3000-Blank-PCB-Rev-1-HaynieMovingSale-100-/131463510992?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;amp;hash=item1e9bd5fbd0&#34;&gt;an Amiga 3000+ prototype board was sold on&#xA;eBay&lt;/a&gt; by none other than Dave Haynie. It fetched a decent $2,155 USD and&#xA;included a couple of his notebooks from the period when he was working on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As if the fact that such a board still exists isn&amp;rsquo;t interesting enough, he&#xA;penned a long description of the board and what was going on at Commodore at&#xA;the time. Unsurprisingly it is yet another exampe of Mehdi Ali and his crew&#xA;destroying what chance Commodore had of actually making a success of the Amiga&#xA;line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a good time to be a retro gaming fan recently with several promising&#xA;Kickstarters. Of course I dawdled too long on writing about them, so some have&#xA;already finished, but they&amp;rsquo;re still worth keeping an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;reformation-2-from-matt-gray&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1289191009/reformation-2-c64-soundtrack-remakes-by-matt-gray&#34;&gt;Reformation 2 from Matt Gray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://files.c64audio.com/reformation.html&#34;&gt;first Reformation&lt;/a&gt; took a little longer to ship than originally&#xA;expected, but it was well worth the wait. 5 CDs of excellent remakes of some&#xA;of the best tunes to grace the C64 (and therefore, games in general). I&amp;rsquo;m a&#xA;huge fan of those old SID tunes, and Matt did a brilliant job of updating them&#xA;while keeping that distinct sound that made them so special&amp;hellip; so I have high&#xA;hopes for volume 2!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was fortunate to see a prototype in action at the Revival&#xA;Solstice event last July when Henrique gave a talk on the project and was very&#xA;impressed. After some high profile crowdfunded retro gaming failures over the&#xA;last couple of years it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be sceptical, but these guys are not only&#xA;doing everything right, but all indications are that their hearts are in the&#xA;right place too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The market seemed to be&#xA;full of these unimaginative and often shoddy tie ins which, aside from the&#xA;attached IP, only had good presentation going for them. Developers were&#xA;feeling the pinch as well: publishers would “guarantee 100,000” copies sold,&#xA;giving them an excuse to lower royalties. Lump sums also went out the window&#xA;as all the money had been blown on the license. The piece ended with:&#xA;“Unfortunately, software houses will continue to release repackaged versions&#xA;of the same old thing if that is what the customers want. Is this really what&#xA;YOU want - or is it all you can get?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;main complaints were around the lack of reviews and the price. The former&#xA;issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of&#xA;time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas&#xA;shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions&#xA;heading to the C64. They included: &amp;ldquo;Tempest” (unreleased?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2559&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Super Sprint&#xA;III”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=833&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Enduro Racer”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2886&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wonder Boy”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2039&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quartet”&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2086&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rampage”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=920&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fire Trap”&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t all arcade ports, though,&#xA;with a bunch of original titles: &amp;ldquo;On-Field Football” (a sequel, but&#xA;unreleased?), &amp;ldquo;Aliens Part II” (unreleased?), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3725&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Star Raiders II”&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3773&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Portal”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3050&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Firetrack”&lt;/a&gt;. Activision was also handling the&#xA;distribution of System 3’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1488&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Last Ninja&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=212&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bangkok Knights”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, that’s&#xA;not entirely true as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=217&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Bard’s Tale&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; picked up a very respectable&#xA;Sizzler, though apparently it didn’t count as it was “a role playing game”. It&#xA;seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before&#xA;Christmas to polish up their hopeful hits. On the bright side, there was a lot&#xA;to look forward to next month…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of these days I’ll get my act together and not wait until the dying hours&#xA;of the month (and even year in this case) to write these things… With that&#xA;said, I did manage to have a decent play on a bunch of the biggest December&#xA;games from 1986 and 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2260&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2016-12-31-20161231december-games-revisited/sentinel_01.png&#34; alt=&#34;”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reviewed Zzap!64 December 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recall playing this quite a bit on the C64. I figured I’d revisit the Amiga&#xA;version as the screen redraw is unsurprisingly somewhat snappier. My first&#xA;attempts were complete failures, and I had to resort to reading the&#xA;instructions (shock horror).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time&#xA;playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of&#xA;travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in&#xA;the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At any rate&amp;hellip; Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in&#xA;November many years ago to rave reviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Commodore did have a stand (which&#xA;apparently bore a resemblance to Parisian public toilets), where they were&#xA;showing off was the Amiga. There was little else of interest, aside from Jeff&#xA;Minter propping up the venue&amp;rsquo;s bar and Martin Galway stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Tynesoft delivering the former, while Ocean took on the latter. Early&#xA;indications were that Batman had the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Loricel&amp;rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche&#xA;racing game &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1079&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;944 Turbo Cup&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Driver Rene Metge (&amp;ldquo;who?&amp;rdquo; asked C&amp;amp;VG)&#xA;provided the endorsement and the software house hoped to include a model car&#xA;in the box, but apparently British retailers weren&amp;rsquo;t so keen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#xA;know he had a Spectrum and later an Amiga&amp;hellip; Maybe it was someone else.. I&amp;rsquo;m&#xA;certain that whoever it was owned an actual legit original, on disk no less&#xA;(I, like most of my friends, was stuck with cassettes). I seem to recall the&#xA;friend raving about it, loading it up to show me only to watch my rather&#xA;unimpressed reaction. What was up with that weird title music?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Roger Kean was moving over&#xA;to a new Newsfield mag called L.M., with Gary Penn stepping in to the Editor&#xA;role. There were three new faces with Richard &amp;ldquo;Dick&amp;rdquo; Eddy, Jonathan Rignall&#xA;(Julian&amp;rsquo;s younger brother) and Massimo Valducci starting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond announced the upcoming release of not one but two Denton Design games:&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=626&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dante’s Inferno&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3524&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Infodroid&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beyond had managed to secure the first ever Star Trek license. Mike&#xA;Singleton would be heading up the project, with two of Denton Designs&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;founders (Kenny Everett and Steve Cain) helping out with the programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

C&amp;amp;VG reassured its readers that almost all the games would make their&#xA;way to the C64/Spectrum/Amstrad, and that the magazine would continue to cover&#xA;those machines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Bitmap Brothers were following up their well received 16bit shoot&amp;rsquo;em up&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1152&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Xenon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; with a new futuristic sports game, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=985&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Speedball&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mirrorsoft had created a new label, Imageworks, which would be their flagship&#xA;for most of its new games. The first titles to be released were: &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2944&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sky&#xA;Chase&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2246&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fernandez Must Die&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and the Atari/Tengen coinop&#xA;conversion, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=170&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blasteroids&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Following those were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=965&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Foxx Strikes&#xA;Back&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=115&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bomboozal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The latter was a puzzle game designed by&#xA;a &amp;ldquo;mega-programming team&amp;rdquo; that included Jeff Minter, Andrew Braybrook, John&#xA;[sic] Ritman and David Bishop. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; these esteemed developers were just&#xA;contributing puzzle designs, rather than working together to create the game&#xA;as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No-one forces them to publish contagious rubbish but&#xA;magazines that do so are not simply to be described as boring, but debasing&#xA;the values of their readership&amp;hellip; and polluting the social and commercial&#xA;environment in which we live and work.&amp;rdquo; Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On the&#xA;one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games&#xA;rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the&#xA;desire to get as many games on the shelves as possible was putting a real&#xA;strain on quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The&#xA;price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than&#xA;address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually&#xA;solve?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;English Software were finally about to release &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=814&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Elektra Glide&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on the&#xA;C64 - some months after the original Atari version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rather than a typical adventure game, each issue would&#xA;allow the reader to choose their path through the storyline. Each comic was&#xA;expected to take around 4-5 hours to read. The first three releases were to&#xA;be: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1476&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lane Mastadon vs The Blubberman&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1019&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gamma Force in Pit of a&#xA;Thousand Screams&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2959&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zorkquest: Assault on Egreth Castle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not&#xA;divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they&#xA;had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some&#xA;&amp;ldquo;savage criticism&amp;rdquo; was in store.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered&#xA;by the fact that a reader had written in to complain about Kean&amp;rsquo;s assertion&#xA;that the C64&amp;rsquo;s xmas release schedule was &amp;ldquo;disappointing&amp;rdquo;. It was a perfectly&#xA;politely worded letter, and just goes to show how much the world has changed.&#xA;Makes one want to weep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This would allow&#xA;them to use much fancier packaging, for starters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Elite started a new budget label, Encore, which would see their back catalogue&#xA;classics re-released.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The cover of the game came with a &amp;ldquo;Not suitable&#xA;for persons under the age of 16&amp;rdquo; label.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paul Hardcastle had a big hit with his Vietnam war song &amp;ldquo;19&amp;rdquo; and Cascade were&#xA;turning it into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000016&#34;&gt;a game&lt;/a&gt;. Rather interestingly, the player would be&#xA;faced with a choice at the start: fight the war or the draft. Choosing the&#xA;former would take the player on an arcade action game, whereas the latter path&#xA;was a text/graphic adventure with the player joining the Peace Corps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This time rather than focussing on the British contribution&#xA;to the industry, they&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking to prominent Amiga developers,&#xA;musicians, demo sceners and so on from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given my love for the Amiga - a machine that was so beautifully and elegantly&#xA;architected and years ahead of its time - I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely delighted they&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;chosen it as the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Competition Pro 5000 came out on top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Harlequin looked back on what was a bit of a lacklustre year for adventure&#xA;games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a round up of the many compilation packs available this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This ushered in Julian Rignall as editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;US Gold acquired the rights to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2179&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rolling Thunder&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2144&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roadblasters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; coin ops. Meanwhile, the publisher dropped the price of&#xA;all of their C64 disk games from £14.99 to £11.99 (thanks to economies of&#xA;scale).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Telecomsoft scored a bit of a coup, signing Graftgold away from Hewson. Not&#xA;only that, but Graftgold had taken Dominic Robinson and John Cumming with&#xA;them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He&#xA;has an impressive list of prominent Amiga folk lined up as contributors and -&#xA;quite rightly - plans to include a section on the demo scene, which played a&#xA;huge role in making the machine so amazing. The campaign smashed through the&#xA;initial goal within a short time but there are still some rather tasty looking&#xA;stretch goals that would be great to hit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The game had begun last December which made it quite a long&#xA;project, although Graftgold switched to a PC dev system early on. While this&#xA;did speed up the development process, it resulted in Andrew writing a much&#xA;bigger program. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2766&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uridium&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had about 18K of code, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=95&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alleykat&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;20K and now &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1720&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Morpheus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was up to 30K.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They&#xA;already had an impressive list of interviewees lined up and the clips they&amp;rsquo;d&#xA;released were very promising. It was clear that the producers had a deep&#xA;respect for the subject and the people they were recording, and that they&#xA;weren&amp;rsquo;t setting out to create some cheesey fluff piece (unlike certain other&#xA;productions). I coughed up more in backing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.frombedroomstobillions.com/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;From Bedrooms&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; than all&#xA;other crowdfunded campaigns I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to combined.

They included Mark&amp;rsquo;s apparent obsession with TV show &amp;ldquo;Magnum&amp;rdquo; (he&#xA;named his dog Apollo after the doberman in the show and bought a red Ferarri&#xA;Mondial), his reputation as a bit of a man about town, and that his favourite&#xA;midday snack was an entire greasy chicken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The ambitious strategy/adventure (which was intended to have&#xA;an optional Play By Mail service to allow players to compete with each other&#xA;and Mike himself) had been in progress for a while and looked fantastic, but&#xA;it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be until February 1988 that C&amp;amp;VG finally got to play it. From the&#xA;review: &amp;ldquo;Was it worth the wait? We&amp;rsquo;ll pass on that&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (it received 8/10)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cup_Carnival&#34;&gt;infamously terrible games of the time&lt;/a&gt;, and was just a repackaging of&#xA;an older title.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mastertronic had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=937&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Flash Gordon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; game in the works which received&#xA;mixed reviews, though the C64 version was easily the best and featured a great&#xA;Rob Hubbard soundtrack.

Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and&#xA;it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The&#xA;magazine had set out to cover &amp;ldquo;every aspect of life&amp;rdquo; for the youth audience,&#xA;but was seen as being &amp;ldquo;too widely targeted&amp;rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy&#xA;sales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fewer, bigger companies&#xA;spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room&#xA;for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book&#xA;publishing where &amp;ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More tweaks were made to Crash&amp;rsquo;s review process. The quality of software had&#xA;improved substantially since the early days and it was time for Crash to take&#xA;a step back and judge games on a scale where 50% meant an average game. No&#xA;doubt this would mean lower scores overall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It will be a turn based affair, set in a fantasy&#xA;realm with magic and unique creatures, and will feature a variety of&#xA;multiplayer modes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ultimate said&#xA;that they were going to concentrate on making games and planned to release six&#xA;new titles during 1986. What wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear was just how involved the Stamper&#xA;brothers were to be, but it would turn out that they already had their eyes on&#xA;the new Japanese consoles and the formation of a certain company called Rare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nintendo seemed unphased by the&#xA;move, saying that they had never lost a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confusion reigned over the specifics for the Konix Slipstream. TGM attempted&#xA;to clear things up by confirming that it would retail at £150 (or slightly&#xA;higher), have a set of peripherals (hydraulic chair, light gun, 3D helmet),&#xA;some of which would be included with the console (not the chair!), and it&#xA;would use 3.5&amp;quot; floppies. TGM promised full coverage next month with a review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Were game developers spending too much time&#xA;and money on the licenses while neglecting the actual games? And was this just&#xA;a temporary phase or would it become a trend?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crash made some changes to their review system: reviews would now be signed,&#xA;and the rated categories were massaged (Getting Started and Use Of Computer&#xA;were replaced by Presentation).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It promised &amp;ldquo;super-&#xA;fast scrolling and authentically addictive action&amp;rdquo; and would certainly end up&#xA;delivering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Infocom slashed the prices on several of their games for a Christmas&#xA;promotion. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1205&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide To The Galaxy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; would drop to £24.95,&#xA;while others would be between £14 and £22.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two schoolboys raised £80 for famine relief in Ethiopia by playing games for&#xA;24 hours. The games included &amp;ldquo;Castle Quest&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0009302&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alien 8&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &amp;ldquo;Revs&amp;rdquo;, all&#xA;on their BBC which apparently &amp;ldquo;did get a bit hot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Costing a mere £149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would&#xA;be able to read software from standard 3&amp;quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks&#xA;were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce -&#xA;customers could look forward to paying only 15 quid for games. The CPU was&#xA;previously thought to be an 8086, but it was now revealed they were going with&#xA;a 68000. This would be accompanied by 4 customised co-processors and an&#xA;&amp;ldquo;extremely fast&amp;rdquo; (70 mips) blitter. Peripherals lined up for launch included&#xA;the hydraulic chair and 3D helmet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I jumped in&#xA;within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games,&#xA;particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to think twice.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride since then - the behind the scenes videos&#xA;are the best accounts of game development ever committed to film, and I almost&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t want them to finish the game as that will mean the end of them. Earlier&#xA;this week Double Fine released part 1 to the backers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/232790/&#34;&gt;while opening up pre-&#xA;orders for everyone else&lt;/a&gt;. I started and finished the game over a period&#xA;of a few hours yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly quite short, which should come as no&#xA;surprise, but it really is a beautiful, charming game. At no point did it make&#xA;me feel stupid, and there were a number of genuinely funny bits. I hope it&#xA;sells absolute bucketloads so we can be treated to more games like this from&#xA;the talented folk at Double Fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A swath of top quality games had come out for the&#xA;Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned all those talented&#xA;programmers weren&amp;rsquo;t going to suddenly jump ship to the new platforms. If only&#xA;Amstrad could sort out the technical problems with the 128K&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A sprawling open world game originally released on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=747&#34;&gt;the&#xA;Amiga in 1989&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Midwinter&amp;rdquo; was an early, influential example of sandbox&#xA;gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game is currently in pre-production, with a Kickstarter campaign expected&#xA;to start in the next few months. The concept art looks great and they have&#xA;Dave Gautrey on board, who was a programmer on the original, so this should be&#xA;an interesting project to watch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the first mention I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;seen of Micronet&amp;rsquo;s digital distribution, but it looks like the company had&#xA;secured publishing rights to games previously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My old 48K only has a partially function keyboard (I really&#xA;should get around to getting a new keyboard membrane for it), and Elite&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;emulation on iOS is generally pretty good so this could be a good way to get a&#xA;more authentic Speccy experience. I certainly hope that it will be useable as&#xA;a standard Bluetooth keyboard so other emulators (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spectaculator-zx-spectrum/id421662150&#34;&gt;Spectaculator&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;can support it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Neither the NES or Master System had managed&#xA;to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000&#xA;units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather&#xA;bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being&#xA;particularly enthusiastic about the Konix Slipstream: &amp;ldquo;I think Konix has the&#xA;potential to be another Amstrad. He [boss Wyn Holloway] has wreaked miracles.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d expect the Slipstream to have an open road until 1990.&amp;rdquo; Of course, the&#xA;Konix never appeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While the game looks to be similar to traditional FMV games, the way the player interacts with it promises to be far more fluid. Murder mysteries are bizarrely under-represented in games and it&amp;rsquo;s a genre that I love dearly, so it&amp;rsquo;s great to see someone taking this on and adding their own twist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Colin is now&#xA;hoping to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/colinjones/slightly-magic-8bit-legacy-edition&#34;&gt;resurrect Slightly, starting with an updated version of &amp;ldquo;Slightly&#xA;Magic&amp;rdquo; followed by two new games to complete the series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It promised to provide cartoon like quality&#xA;graphics but the game then promptly disappeared, only to resurface some time&#xA;later as a very good, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004365&#34;&gt;very different game&lt;/a&gt; developed for Elite by&#xA;Gargoyle Games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Christian Urqhart (programmer behind games like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001217&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Daley Thompson&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;Decathlon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002383&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hunchback&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) had left Ocean and formed his own&#xA;company, Alphabatim. The first game would be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004190&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Robot Messiah&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which&#xA;received a luke warm reception and would be the company&amp;rsquo;s last.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The venue was the Camden&#xA;Palace and plenty of gaming bigwigs were in attendance. Sadly the magazine&#xA;failed to gain much traction, folding after only a handful of issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The release of Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Spectrum +2 had many scratching their heads. Despite&#xA;the official release having taken place in September, people were unable to&#xA;find any in shops. This may have had something to do with rumoured technical&#xA;problems. To add to peoples&amp;rsquo; frustrations, the design of the machine meant it&#xA;was impossible to plug in some peripherals like the popular Interface 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&#xA;was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The&#xA;reception was luke warm at best: &amp;ldquo;is Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business&#xA;computer or a games machine that&amp;rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date&#xA;was to be January 28th and would include a bunch of add ons, including the&#xA;hydraulic chair. It was hard not to get caught up in the wave of hype for this&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not&#xA;terribly keen on the title of the book (&amp;ldquo;Hints &amp;amp; Tips for Videogame Pioneers&amp;rdquo;)&#xA;as it sounds a bit like those &amp;ldquo;Learn how to program C++ in 24 hours!&amp;rdquo; books,&#xA;but I would love to read his accounts of what was one my favourite software&#xA;houses of the 80s/90s. He has a bunch of great people on board, like Steve&#xA;Turner, Ben Daglish, Nick Jones, Jeroen Tell and Mike Male, so it should be&#xA;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The main one would be a &amp;ldquo;super ST&amp;rdquo; that would take on the Amiga,&#xA;then there was a portable ST, a &amp;ldquo;Pocket PC&amp;rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only&#xA;that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a&#xA;software bundle valued at £440. How many of these would actually hit the&#xA;selves?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That number&#xA;placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver&#xA;Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the&#xA;increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield, Frey had too much on his&#xA;plate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First up were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006604&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lords of Midnight&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2278&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shadowfire&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2035&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quake Minus One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rumours surfaced that a certain Gary Liddon had secretly added a scrolling&#xA;text message in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000009&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A View to a Kill&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; while he was still working at&#xA;Domark, much to the annoyance of management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Full details of what was on display&#xA;would be in next month&amp;rsquo;s issue, but there was a boatload of previews to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not one but two winners had been chosen for the Genesis competition Crash&#xA;launched a few months earlier. The first was a shoot em up called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002678&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kat&#xA;Trap&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by John Eggleton that would hopefully be out by Christmas, while&#xA;the second - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0012470&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Sewer&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Martin Lee - was planned for Spring. While&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Kat Trap&amp;rdquo; did make it out and was well received, &amp;ldquo;The Sewer&amp;rdquo; seems to have&#xA;disappeared without a trace. Rather intriguingly, one of the two designs to&#xA;receive an &amp;ldquo;Award of Merit&amp;rdquo;, one was called &amp;ldquo;Leper Attack at Lemming Rock&amp;rdquo; by&#xA;Ian Bell - possibly &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bell_(programmer)&#34;&gt;Ian Bell of &amp;ldquo;Elite&amp;rdquo; fame&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve never&#xA;met them myself, but everyone I know that has has nothing but glowing things&#xA;to say about them - they&amp;rsquo;ve been an immense help to many UK developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A combination of a very&#xA;generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST&#xA;see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still&#xA;having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%.&#xA;Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small South Wales company called Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) was about to&#xA;release a Spectrum &amp;ldquo;super clone&amp;rdquo;. The SAM would feature 256K standard,&#xA;upgradeable to 512K. Retailers doubted whether it could make an impact, and so&#xA;it was only going to be available by mail order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It would be a top down arcade&#xA;game with role playing elements where the player took control of one of six&#xA;characters. It was very much a multiplayer game, and the AI had been designed&#xA;so that they computer would fill in for any unused players. The graphical&#xA;style was fresh and quite unique and the game would become known as one of the&#xA;first examples of Steampunk. The game was, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1848&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Chaos&#xA;Engine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle&#xA;for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine&#xA;but was now accepting that it&amp;rsquo;s destiny would be games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sugar&amp;rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s Sky satellite TV&#xA;company which would see Amstrad producing and selling £199 dishes that would&#xA;receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following&#xA;year. Robert Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s BSB was also in the running, but had received some&#xA;scorn due to adopting an arguably superior format other than PAL meaning&#xA;separate dishes would be required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This game has&#xA;always struck me as an obvious candidate for an update, so it&amp;rsquo;s good to hear&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s finally happening. Development duties are being handled by Abstraction&#xA;Games who most recently ported Hotline Miami to the PS3 an Vita. Fingers&#xA;crossed it&amp;rsquo;ll have been worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More details can be found over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://retroasylum.com/the-chaos-engine-coming-soon-to-pc-mac-and-linux/&#34;&gt;Retro Asylum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both&#xA;were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the&#xA;music).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&amp;rsquo;s games in the US, they were&#xA;strangely absent from UK shelves. This was about to change with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1258&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hypersports&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &amp;ldquo;Konami Tennis&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2919&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yie Ar Kung-Fu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hyper Rally&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Golf&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1679&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mikie&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=524&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Comic Bakery&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I might be&#xA;wrong, but I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Hypersports&amp;rdquo; was Martin Galway&amp;rsquo;s debut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps more importantly, they&amp;rsquo;re&#xA;asking for considerably less. Hopefully this time they&amp;rsquo;ll make it, though I do&#xA;wonder why the campaign is only lasting for 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was an attempt to bring &amp;ldquo;computer art&amp;rdquo; into the mainstream - not just graphics, but works using fabric etc. Elsewhere, Carnegie Mellon began a course on writing &amp;ldquo;interactive fiction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CRL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2883&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wolfman&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was in the news for &lt;em&gt;failing&lt;/em&gt; to be slapped with a British Board of Censors rating certificate, unlike their previous adventures. This was apparently due to the game having &amp;ldquo;less animated&amp;rdquo; questionable material (animated being the key thing).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Palace Software announced a sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=214&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barbarian&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=215&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barbarian - The Dungeon of Drax&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the article was a mention that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2793&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vixen&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; from Martech was about to be released (if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the connection was, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Barbarain_II_cover_art.jpg&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Vixen1988.jpg&#34;&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-previews&#34;&gt;Notable Previews&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hewson announced their first foray onto the 16bits - a port of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1171&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zynaps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a couple of 8bit games on the way: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1595&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marauder&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1779&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Netherworld&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. There was mention of two other games - &amp;ldquo;Roadstar XRi&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Azimodious - Angel of Death&amp;rdquo; - but I don&amp;rsquo;t think they ever saw the light of day. Meanwhile there was speculation as to what Raffaele Cecco had up his sleeve for Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1489&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Last Ninja II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was nearing release, after a reported &amp;ldquo;8,000 man-hours of development and planning&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ocean had a couple of new coin-op conversions: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=803&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operation Wolf&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2740&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Typhoon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hard to believe it took so long to get a sequel, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001827&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Football Manager II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Addictive was about to be released. Speaking of which, Kevin Toms has been beavering away on a spanking brand &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20220110054844/https://blog.kevintoms.com/&#34;&gt;new version for iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1091&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great Giana Sisters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had its release date set for July. This rather excellent game was soon pulled from the shelves after legal action by Nintendo.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Magnetic Scrolls&amp;rsquo; latest - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1557&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corruption&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - was due to hit shelves in June. I have very fond memories playing this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The game that was the poster child for the Archimedes, &amp;ldquo;Zarch&amp;rdquo;, was finally coming to the Amiga and ST (under the name &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1361&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Virus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mel Croucher interviewed several industry folk on what things (specifically Big Brother related) would be like in 2001. Some quite amusing, slightly bonkers responses about government surveillance but, well, they weren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far off, were they?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To accompany Croucher&amp;rsquo;s look at the dark side of technology, there was a look at what games and game development might resemble in 2001. Lots of talk of RISC, parallel processing, transputers, realistic AI and so on. These articles always seem quaintly naive in retrospect, but it makes you appreciate how far you&amp;rsquo;ve come - and who knows what awaits in the near future. Remember that back then there was no publicly accessible Internet, and even laptops that you could use on your lap seemed like science fiction. Perhaps the most interesting theme of the piece for me was: technology isn&amp;rsquo;t entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continuing the whole &amp;ldquo;The Future!&amp;rdquo; theme, TGM went to the Ideal Home Exhibition to see the &amp;ldquo;Vision 2020 Home of the Future.&amp;rdquo; It was all rather silly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To round off this peek into the future, Mel Croucher went over the history of sound in games, and had some thoughts on what was in store.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The MSX-II had recently launched and the options (one from Sony and one from Philips) were examined. Promising, but never went anywhere in the West.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There was a &amp;ldquo;hard hitting&amp;rdquo; investigation into the alleged practice of software houses deliberately supplying pirates of games before they were released. Somewhat bizarrely, apart from the introduction, there was absolutely no further mention of this deliberate supply, but just that some developers were getting access to leaks from other companies to see what the competition was up to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-reviews&#34;&gt;Notable Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=234&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carrier Command&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Realtime/Rainbird - ST 98% &amp;ldquo;Carrier Command is a seminal game destined to change the state of software and, as such, ranks alongside programs as Elite, Knight Lore, Flight Simulator 2 and The Hobbit&amp;hellip; In short, Rainbird have done it again, bringing us masterpiece of coding which will almost certainly be THE game of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004087&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target Renegade&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Imagine - Spectrum 85% &amp;ldquo;A distinct improvement over the original, the Spectrum game is a very good sequel - and tough - indeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002676&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Karnov&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Electric Dreams - Spectrum 88% &amp;ldquo;Should prove popular, with stacks of lasting appeal in nine tortuous levels and addictive action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1139&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wizball&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Ocean - ST 87% Amiga 84% &amp;ldquo;Although the games&amp;rsquo; structures remains identical to their 8-bit cousin, the ST and Amiga conversions have lost the fun element.&amp;rdquo; Too true - easily one of my biggest gaming disappointments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

According to the rumours the machine&#xA;would be Spectrum based but would use credit card sized &amp;ldquo;cartridges&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Reactions were mixed - while this would drastically reduce piracy, software&#xA;houses feared Amstrad having control over what games would be released. During&#xA;the announcement of the Amstrad takeover of Sinclair, Alan Sugar suggested&#xA;that they may introduce an &amp;ldquo;approval process&amp;rdquo; for the regular Spectrum to try&#xA;to lessen software incompatibility between hardware revisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well, Mel is now looking for backers to help&#xA;fund the final stages of production. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure of just how the game&#xA;will turn out (the original was more about the experience as a whole, rather&#xA;than they gameplay itself), but it cannot be overstated how important the&#xA;original and Mel himself was to the early game scene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First there were the new XEs which were basically upgraded/re-styled 800 XLs.

A gala awards dinner was held which handed out awards based on&#xA;Crash and Zzap!64 reader awards. Best Spectrum game went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001521&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Driller&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;from Incentive, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=407&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;California Games&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; from Epyx/US Gold winning best&#xA;C64 game.

What would this mean for Sinclair&#xA;products? The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded&#xA;like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum. Overall it was taken as a&#xA;positive happening, though the alternative would&amp;rsquo;ve been receivership for&#xA;Sinclair. Sir Clive himself was to return to research. At the press conference&#xA;where the sale was announced he said, &amp;ldquo;Nothing ever goes the way I plan it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t know&#xA;if the BBC had specified &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; this was to happen, as it would last another 4&#xA;years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Designer of the Month&amp;rdquo; was Stephen Redman, a 21 year old uni student who&#xA;released the somewhat controversial (how innocent we all were) game &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001271&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Day in&#xA;the Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The game sees the player try to guide Sir Clive through his&#xA;day and onto a very important appointment at Buckingham Palace. From what I&#xA;can tell, this was Stephen&amp;rsquo;s only game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to the site,&#xA;not only is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deusexmachina2.com/&#34;&gt;Deus Ex Machina 2&lt;/a&gt; on the way, but also remakes of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.automatasource.com/pimania.aspx&#34;&gt;PiMania&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.automatasource.com/thanatos.aspx&#34;&gt;Thanatos&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is interesting seeing as&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Croucher had nothing to do with the original.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001373&#34;&gt;Deus Ex Machina&lt;/a&gt; was quite easily one of the most&#xA;incredible game experiences I had during that time. I still occasionally&#xA;listen to the soundtrack to this day (voiced by the likes of Ian Dury, Jon&#xA;Pertwee, Donna Bailey and Frankie Howerd). It really was a remarkable work and&#xA;completely unlike anything then or since. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell how close the&#xA;sequel is to release - apparently Spring 2013. The soundtrack has been&#xA;produced and is available to buy, but the footage of the game itself looks&#xA;very ropey - it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since the trailer was made, so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;come along somewhat since then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This all&#xA;follows on from a pretty amazing interview with Rare in the previous issue of&#xA;TGM - amazing because it was the first (and perhaps only?) proper interview&#xA;conducted with the Stamper brothers. Everyone had been wondering what happened&#xA;to Ultimate Play The Game (arguably the finest developer of the 8bit years),&#xA;and now we all knew. Their arcade board would never see the light of day, but&#xA;I know someone who worked with it and it sounded rather tasty indeed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their&#xA;games were known for being well written with a keen sense of humour. Then&#xA;there was the fact that they &lt;em&gt;appeared&lt;/em&gt; to be a company consisting entirely of&#xA;women (quite unique in the industry), as they were generally referred to as&#xA;&amp;ldquo;the sisters&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;the ladies&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;the belles&amp;rdquo;/etc of St Brides (to what extent this&#xA;was actually the case, I&amp;rsquo;m unsure).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Crash pondered whether this had anything&#xA;to do with the recent release of the Spectrum 128K. Game compilations (often&#xA;tied to a charity) were coming out at a ridiculous rate - would this result in&#xA;the cost of games for the consumer (typically kids) going down? or will the&#xA;revenue developers see take a big hit as people choose cheap compilations over&#xA;&amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; release games?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Forget Halo, or Gears of War, or Mass Effect; SWOS was what I&#xA;cared about. The Amiga version is the game I routinely tell people is &amp;ldquo;the&#xA;best game ever made&amp;rdquo; and I played it everyday for years during the 90s. While&#xA;people may scoff at rating a football game so highly, I&amp;rsquo;m certainly &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensible_Soccer_(series)&#34;&gt;not the&#xA;only one&lt;/a&gt;#Awards).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.frombedroomstobillions.com/&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2013-03-11-2013312from-bedrooms-to-billions/bedrooms_to_billions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bedrooms_to_billions.jpg&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a successful round of crowdfunding last year, the people behind the&#xA;&amp;ldquo;From Bedrooms to Billions&amp;rdquo; documentary and conducting a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1195082866/from-bedrooms-to-billions&#34;&gt;Kickstarter&#xA;campaign&lt;/a&gt; in order to cover the myriad of costs involved in finishing and&#xA;polishing the film. With the passing of Mike Singleton, it&amp;rsquo;s become clear that&#xA;we need to record the histories of the people involved in the UK games&#xA;industry during the 80s. The interviews they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to snag are extremely&#xA;impressive - so many of my heroes are in there. Naturally there are some&#xA;omissions, but this is obviously the product of people who feel passionately&#xA;about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Year Walk (iOS)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/year-walk/id555916407?mt=8&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2013-02-24-2013225year-walk-ios/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;The walk begins.&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The walk begins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it isn&amp;rsquo;t retro related as such, this certainly deserves a mention. Last&#xA;week the consistently excellent iOS developer &lt;a href=&#34;http://simogo.com/&#34;&gt;Simogo&lt;/a&gt; released their&#xA;latest game, &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/year-walk/id555916407&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Year Walk&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a highly atmospheric affair, rather&#xA;beautiful yet sinister, that references various Swedish folk tales (the &amp;ldquo;Year&#xA;Walk&amp;rdquo; itself being an old tradition). After a brief setup, the player is&#xA;placed in a snowy landscape with no instructions on what to do - the game is&#xA;all about letting the player discover everything for themselves. Simogo have&#xA;done a great job to make this discovery a natural, intuitive thing to do. The&#xA;puzzles were enjoyable and the game never made me feel stupid&amp;hellip; well, apart&#xA;from one particular bit where I knew there was &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; I had to interact&#xA;with (so not a puzzle as such), but took me a long time to find it. But that&#xA;was the only moment of frustration I felt. Recommended!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Archipelagos (iOS)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/news/2013/2/20/archipelagos-ios/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/app/id595365875&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2013-02-20-2013220archipelagos-ios/394960_204273639712143_1723476887_n.png&#34; alt=&#34;394960_204273639712143_1723476887_n.png&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Archipelagos appeared on the Amiga back in 1989 and is a first person realtime&#xA;puzzle/strategy game. I certainly remember playing it, but I also remember not&#xA;really knowing what I was doing. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat reminiscent of The Sentinel&#xA;(surely a remake of that must be on the cards?), and features 9999&#xA;procedurally generated levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original scored well in magazines of the day (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=051&amp;amp;page=067&amp;amp;thumbstart=0&amp;amp;magazine=zzap&amp;amp;check=1&#34;&gt;Zzap! gave it 90%&lt;/a&gt;)&#xA;and the remake is a decent job, though it feels a little rough and finicky -&#xA;it seems to be a pretty straightforward port of the modern desktop version and&#xA;the touch controls could use some love. With that said, it&amp;rsquo;s enjoyable and&#xA;even features the original music by David Whittaker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
