            <strong>News</strong> For the first time, major games were being released on the 16bits before the 8bits. C&amp;VG reassured its readers that almost all the games would make their way to the C64/Spectrum/Amstrad, and that the magazine would continue to cover those machines. The Bitmap Brothers were following up their well received 16bit shoot&rsquo;em up &ldquo;Xenon&rdquo; with a new futuristic sports game, &ldquo;Speedball&rdquo;. Mirrorsoft had created a new label, Imageworks,...

            <strong>News</strong> The Commodore Show in London was the biggest dedicated C64 event of the year. Zzap!&rsquo;s own booth proved very popular - especially when games programmers dropped by to show off their latest wares (often yet to be signed to a publisher). So why weren&rsquo;t the crowds impressed with the show? It seemed software houses were very thin on the ground&hellip; Tony Takoushi was at the show touting a...

            <strong>News</strong> Antony Jacobson wrote a withering attack on Zzap! and Crash in Computer Trade Weekly. It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &ldquo;&hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs. No-one forces them to publish contagious rubbish but magazines that do so are not simply to be described as boring, but debasing the values of their readership&hellip;...
