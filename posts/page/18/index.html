            <strong>News</strong> The biggest news by far this month was that US Gold had merged with Ultimate Play The Game, and that US Gold would now handle all international manufacturing, promotion, marketing and sales of Ultimate games. Ultimate said that they were going to concentrate on making games and planned to release six new titles during 1986. What wasn&rsquo;t clear was just how involved the Stamper brothers were to be,...

            <strong>News</strong> Atari Games (not to be confused with hardware manufacturer, Atari) sued Nintendo for $100 million over the inability to publish games for the NES without going through the Japanese company. Nintendo seemed unphased by the move, saying that they had never lost a lawsuit. Confusion reigned over the specifics for the Konix Slipstream. TGM attempted to clear things up by confirming that it would retail at £150 (or...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Graeme Kidd lamented the glut of poor games with big movie, TV and arcade licenses attached. Were game developers spending too much time and money on the licenses while neglecting the actual games? And was this just a temporary phase or would it become a trend? Crash made some changes to their review system: reviews would now be signed, and the rated categories were massaged...

            <strong>News</strong> Andrew Braybrook revealed his new game, &ldquo;Uridium&rdquo;. It promised &ldquo;super- fast scrolling and authentically addictive action&rdquo; and would certainly end up delivering. Infocom slashed the prices on several of their games for a Christmas promotion. &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide To The Galaxy&rdquo; would drop to £24.95, while others would be between £14 and £22. Two schoolboys raised £80 for famine relief in Ethiopia by playing games for 24 hours. The...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw a new &ldquo;bigger and brighter&rdquo; look for TGM. Excitement was growing for the impending release of the Konix Slipstream megaconsole. Costing a mere £149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would be able to read software from standard 3&quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce - customers could...

            The Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter was one of those few moments where you feel like you&rsquo;re actually seeing a seismic shift in the industry. I jumped in within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games, particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&rsquo;t need to think twice. It&rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride...

A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned...

            Chris Wild, who was behind the excellent iOS remake of &ldquo;Lords of Midnight&rdquo;, has announced that his company is now taking on a brand new version of another Mike Singleton classic &ldquo;Midwinter&rdquo;. &ldquo;Midwinter&rdquo; received considerable critical claim but slipped by unnoticed by many (including myself). A sprawling open world game originally released on the Amiga in 1989, &ldquo;Midwinter&rdquo; was an early, influential example of sandbox gameplay. The game&hellip;...

Domark released a screenshot of their rather controversial &ldquo;Friday the 13th&rdquo;. The game certainly got the attention of the press but - unsurprisingly - for all the wrong reasons, as it turned out to be rubbish. (&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear&rdquo; lamented Crash in their review).

My old 48K only has a partially function keyboard (I really should get around to getting a new keyboard membrane for it), and Elite&rsquo;s emulation on iOS is generally pretty good so this could be a good way to get a more authentic Speccy experience. I certainly hope that it will be useable as a standard...
