            <strong>News</strong> US Gold had signed the licenses to a couple of Disney games, &ldquo;Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood&rdquo; and &ldquo;Donald Duck&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo;. Both were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the music). Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&rsquo;s games in the US, they were strangely absent from UK shelves. This was about to change with &ldquo;Hypersports&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;Konami Tennis&rdquo;,...

The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum. Overall it was taken as a positive happening, though the alternative would&rsquo;ve been receivership for Sinclair. Sir Clive himself was to return...
