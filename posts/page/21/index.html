            !chaos_engine_(aga)_02.png Rather exciting news: a remake of the excellent Amiga game The Chaos Engine has been announced for PS, Mac and Linux. This game has always struck me as an obvious candidate for an update, so it&rsquo;s good to hear it&rsquo;s finally happening. Development duties are being handled by Abstraction Games who most recently ported Hotline Miami to the PS3 an Vita. Fingers crossed it&rsquo;ll have been worth the wait. More...

            <strong>News</strong> US Gold had signed the licenses to a couple of Disney games, &ldquo;Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood&rdquo; and &ldquo;Donald Duck&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo;. Both were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the music). Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&rsquo;s games in the US, they were strangely absent from UK shelves. This was about to change with &ldquo;Hypersports&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;Konami Tennis&rdquo;,...
