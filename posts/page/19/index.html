            !001_rg_121_no-spine.jpg 820 The site for the best retro gaming magazine out there (and, arguably, one of the finest gaming mags ever) has received a lick of fresh paint. It looks like they&rsquo;ll be updating it more frequently with new articles, and emphasis on profiles (be they a game, old software house, retro hero or community member) should be interesting. I&rsquo;ve been subscribing since around issue 15 (issue 123 has just...

            <strong>News</strong> A Crash contingent went down to London for the 20th ZX Microfair. While the event was usually held in the &ldquo;cavernous&rdquo; Royal Horticultural Hall, a booking mixup meant this one had to move to &ldquo;several rooms and various floors&rdquo; at Central Hall in Westminster. There were very few new products to talk about, the only ones receiving a mention being &ldquo;The Professional Adventure Writing System&rdquo;, a new disk...

            !contradiction.png 785 Tim Follin (one of the great composers from the 8/16 bit years) has launched a rather interesting looking Kickstarter campaign for an &ldquo;interactive murder mystery movie&rdquo; called &ldquo;Contradiction&rdquo;. While the game looks to be similar to traditional FMV games, the way the player interacts with it promises to be far more fluid. Murder mysteries are bizarrely under-represented in games and it&rsquo;s a genre that I love dearly, so...

            <strong>News</strong> Ariolasoft released a couple of screenshots from a new game which promised to be a &ldquo;totally interactive graphic adventure &lsquo;movie&rsquo;.&rdquo; The game, &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo;, received luke warm reviews, but it was notable in that it was one of those rarities at the time: a game developed behind the iron curtain. Activision were to take on EA&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;Racing Destruction Set&rdquo; with their own racing game with a built...

Colin is now hoping to resurrect Slightly, starting with an updated...

It promised to provide cartoon like quality graphics but the game then promptly disappeared, only to resurface some time later as a very good, but very different game developed for Elite by Gargoyle Games. Christian Urqhart (programmer behind games like &ldquo;Daley Thompson&rsquo;s Decathlon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hunchback&rdquo;) had left Ocean and formed his own...

            <strong>News</strong> The Crash staff, along with all the other Newsfield folk, went down to London for the launch party of their new magazine, LM. The venue was the Camden Palace and plenty of gaming bigwigs were in attendance. Sadly the magazine failed to gain much traction, folding after only a handful of issues. The release of Amstrad&rsquo;s Spectrum +2 had many scratching their heads. Despite the official release having...

            <strong>News</strong> After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The reception was luke warm at best: &ldquo;is Amstrad&rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business computer or a games machine that&rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&rdquo; Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date was to be January 28th and would include a bunch...

Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many...
