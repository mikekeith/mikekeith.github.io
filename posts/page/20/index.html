            !dragontorc_ad.jpg Andrew Hewson is running a Kickstarter for a new book detailing his experiences and insights from a long career in videogame development. I&rsquo;m not terribly keen on the title of the book (&ldquo;Hints &amp; Tips for Videogame Pioneers&rdquo;) as it sounds a bit like those &ldquo;Learn how to program C++ in 24 hours!&rdquo; books, but I would love to read his accounts of what was one my favourite software houses...

            <strong>News</strong> Word on the street was that Atari was readying not one, but <em>four</em> new ST machines. The main one would be a &ldquo;super ST&rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a &ldquo;Pocket PC&rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many...

            <strong>News</strong> Celebrations at Crash towers as the latest circulation figures showed they had sold 101,483 copies a month on average between January and June. That number placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags. This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield,...

The excellent &ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo; was going to be re-launched by Silversoft and would feature new locations and graphics. Beyond struck a deal with Mindscape that would see its games distributed in the the US. First up were &ldquo;Lords of Midnight&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shadowfire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quake...

The Oliver Twins have been prominent members of the UK games industry since they shot to fame in the 80s for their much loved Dizzy series of games.

            <strong>News</strong> Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST. A small...
