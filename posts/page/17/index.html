            <strong>News</strong> Activision announced &ldquo;Murder on the Missippisic&quot;81, which was being written by Adam Bellin. Rather oddly C&amp;VG described Bellin as &ldquo;part of the team who produced the controversial &lsquo;Ghostbusters&rsquo;&rdquo;. I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...

            <strong>News</strong> One year and two months after Newsfield launched LM, the decision was made to end the experiment. Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The magazine had set out to cover &ldquo;every aspect of life&rdquo; for the youth audience, but was seen as being &ldquo;too widely targeted&rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy sales....

            <strong>News</strong> Tony Crowther moved back Alligata, the company he started out with. He had briefly run his own software house called Wizard Developments. After finding success with Delta4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo; CRL had signed up the new St Brides spoof &ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure&rdquo;. Little of the much hyped &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo; had been heard over the previous few months, but now it had resurfaced with news that Beyond...

            <strong>News</strong> More changes at Crash towers this month with three new staff members: Ian Phillipson, Gareth Adams and, perhaps most notably, Ciaran Brennan. Mastertronic was branching out into the video and music markets by launching the Master Vision and Master Sound labels. The Tau Ceti system was to once again be the setting for a new game from CRL called &ldquo;Traxxion&rdquo;. Piracy was rife in the USSR with the...

            <strong>News</strong> Roger Kean, who was the original editor of Crash, returned to resume his role after moving to Zzap64 a couple of years earlier (which had earned him the title of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; from loyal Spectrum fans). Graeme Kidd was now to be editor of the ill fated LM magazine. Spring had arrived and there were a slew of announcements by software houses of upcoming games. Some of the notable...

            <strong>News</strong> The UK release of &ldquo;Questprobe 3&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;The Fantastic Four&rdquo;) had suffered more delays. There had been hopes it&rsquo;d be out for Christmas, but it looks like licensing issues had pushed it back. Rhino announced &ldquo;Ark Pandora&rdquo; for the C64. PSS had released two new wargames: &ldquo;Falklands 82&rdquo; for the Spectrum and &ldquo;Theatre of Europe&rdquo; for the Amstrad. Global Software announced a game based on &ldquo;the Worst Vegetable...

            <strong>News</strong> Word leaked out that Epyx was working on a new console. David Morse (CEO of Epyx, and one of the original Amiga hardware designers) was involved on what was rumoured to be a new handheld. This, of course, would become the Atari Lynx. Megadrives and NES consoles started appearing in arcades in the UK where players could purchase a set amount of play time with a range of...

            <strong>News</strong> With yet more consolidation of software houses, Graeme Kidd painted a rather bleak outlook for innovative and original games. Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&rdquo; More tweaks were made to Crash&rsquo;s review process....

            !126 After about a year of building a prototype and refining the systems, Julian Gollop has launched a Kickstarter for &ldquo;Chaos Reborn&rdquo;. Gollop has created many brilliant games over the years - &ldquo;Rebelstar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Laser Squad&rdquo; and &ldquo;X-Com&rdquo; to name a few - and now he&rsquo;s returning to one of his first, &ldquo;Chaos&rdquo;. It will be a turn based affair, set in a fantasy realm with magic and unique creatures, and will...

            <strong>News</strong> The biggest news by far this month was that US Gold had merged with Ultimate Play The Game, and that US Gold would now handle all international manufacturing, promotion, marketing and sales of Ultimate games. Ultimate said that they were going to concentrate on making games and planned to release six new titles during 1986. What wasn&rsquo;t clear was just how involved the Stamper brothers were to be,...
