            At the end of August - almost 29 years to the day since I begun my career in the games industry - I resigned and entered into what Ive been describing as retiremen. The quotes indicating that I havent quite decided what form it will take....

            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for Â£5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

            <strong>News</strong> The One had had a bit of a facelift with the Contents page getting a re- design, along with various sections getting re-labelled. The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

            <strong>News</strong> Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

            <strong>News</strong> While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a âbuying showâ where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if thereâd be any Commodore kit left...

            <strong>News</strong> After reporting that the saga of Commodore&rsquo;s fate would be resolved &ldquo;any day now&rdquo; for the past few months, The One decided to quit guessing the timeline. In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen. At the US head office Mehdi Ali was officially...

It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;. A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value...
