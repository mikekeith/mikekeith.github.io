            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

            <strong>News</strong> The One had had a bit of a facelift with the Contents page getting a re- design, along with various sections getting re-labelled. The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

The only &ldquo;big names&rdquo; attached to it were Christopher Lambert and Talisa Soto (a Bond girl in &ldquo;Licence to Kill&rdquo;). Unknown Paul Anderson was to direct. Elsewhere...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

            <strong>News</strong> Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

It was to be a “buying show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left...

In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen.
