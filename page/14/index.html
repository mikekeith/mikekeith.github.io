            <strong>News</strong> Jim Synoski and Arnold Hendrick, designers of Microprose&rsquo;s &ldquo;Project: Stealth Fighter&rdquo;, were promoting the game ahead of its launch. While they admitted nothing official was known about the fighter, they felt that they had &ldquo;a fair idea of what the capabilities of the plane must be&rdquo;. Incentive&rsquo;s &ldquo;Driller&rdquo; was shaping up well on the Speccy. Electric Dreams had the rights to &ldquo;Knightmare&rdquo; - the game of the TV...

English Software were working on a Rambo-esque game: &ldquo;Captain Courageous&rdquo;. Atari dropped the price of the 520STFM to £299.99.

            <strong>News</strong> Perhaps the biggest news for Zzap! readers this month was that Julian Rignall had left Newsfield to take up freelancing (including for rival publisher EMAP). Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start). Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;, &ldquo;World Darts&rdquo; (may have become &ldquo;180&rdquo;), &ldquo;Night Racer&rdquo; and a...

Microprose were to release a new flight sim, &ldquo;Project: Stealth Fighter&rdquo; based on the top secret American stealth plane, and a more arcade-y combat game, &ldquo;Airborne Ranger&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> Mastertronic was to release a followup to &ldquo;Kane&rdquo;, unsurprisingly called &ldquo;Kane II&rdquo;. Up until this point Microprose&rsquo;s games had been distributed in the UK by US Gold, but now they were going to handle it all themselves. This would allow them to use much fancier packaging, for starters. Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations. Elite started a new budget label, Encore, which would see their back...

The cover of the game came with a &ldquo;Not suitable for persons under the age of 16&rdquo; label. Paul Hardcastle had a big hit with his Vietnam war song &ldquo;19&rdquo; and Cascade were turning it into a game. Rather interestingly, the player would be faced...

Domark were producing &ldquo;Live and Let Die&rdquo;, a game based on Roger Moore&rsquo;s first Bond film. &ldquo;Barbarian II&rdquo; was due for release in August and promised a &ldquo;multiload extravaganza&rdquo; with a large, mappable area.

Meanwhile, US Gold released &ldquo;Deeper Dungeons&rdquo; for those &ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo; fans wanting more. The British Open AD&amp;D Championships were held at the Reading University Students Union building. Up to 600 people were expected. Laser tag guns were the toy of the moment.

Seems that only &ldquo;Thunder Force&rdquo; (published by Hewson) and &ldquo;Vikings&rdquo; made it out. &ldquo;The Mystery of Arkham Manor&rdquo; would see the player take on...
