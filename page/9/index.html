            <strong>News</strong> The industry was abuzz with talk of Nintendo’s Game Boy. The handheld had seen a very successful launch in Japan with over 500,000 units being sold (300,000 of which were on the first day), and now the question was when would it reach the UK. Nintendo were unable to give any dates, but confirmed they had plans… The FIST telephone game was getting a sequel (I have no...

            ! 3533 While the announcement of the SNES mini is hardly a surprise, especially given the runaway success of its 8bit sibling, the inclusion of Star Fox 2 certainly is. The sequel to arguably one of the finest games of the 16bit era was cancelled late into its development and never saw the light of day (aside from a leaked prototype ROM). I missed out on the NES mini, mainly...

            ! 3520 Way back in the mists of time (well, 1982) my parents took me and my sister out of school for a few months to embark on a trip around the UK, Europe and the US. For the European leg we jaunted about in a campervan, staying at campsites (and occasionally on roadsides) along the way. My memories of that time are sadly vague - my main recollection is...

            <strong>News</strong> Firebird closed a deal with Activision/Electric Dreams which would see the budget publisher re-releasing a slew of older titles from the US for £1.99 each. No changes at Zzap! this month, though Julian Rignall got engaged to Glenys Powell, the “ever-effervescent” Editorial Assistant. Zzap! launched in Italy. Note the lack of “64” - Speccy, Atari, MSX and C16 gamers would all be catered for. The Sensi Software lads...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw C&amp;VG getting a revamp based on reader feedback. Coin ops and consoles would get more pages, the adventure section got a make over, there was more space dedicated to previews and overall there would be a lot more colour. The announcement of these changes referenced the fact that some features were dropped, but they didn’t actually specify which. Somewhat worryingly, there were no adventure game...

Their first release is a a remaster of the classic adventure &ldquo;The Pawn&rdquo;, available for Mac, Win and Linux. Not only that, but they have the support of other Magnetic Scrolls alumni, including Anita Sinclair and Ken Gordon. I stumbled across their site somewhat...

So I finally got around to picking up a few. From Psytronkik there is: * &ldquo;Kung Fu Maniacs Trilogy&rdquo; * &ldquo;Gravitrix&rdquo; * &ldquo;X-Force&rdquo; * &ldquo;Space Trip 2086&rdquo;.

The reason for such a cover? Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed no signs of letting up.
