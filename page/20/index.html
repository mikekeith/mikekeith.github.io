            <strong>News</strong> Celebrations at Crash towers as the latest circulation figures showed they had sold 101,483 copies a month on average between January and June. That number placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags. This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield,...

            <strong>News</strong> After months of teasing, the new look for C&amp;VG was here. It was quite a radical change and still looks pretty decent today. The excellent &ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo; was going to be re-launched by Silversoft and would feature new locations and graphics. Beyond struck a deal with Mindscape that would see its games distributed in the the US. First up were &ldquo;Lords of Midnight&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shadowfire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quake...

Full details of what was on display would be in next month&rsquo;s issue, but there was a boatload of previews to do. Not one but two winners had been chosen for the Genesis competition Crash launched a few months earlier. The first was a shoot em up called &ldquo;Kat Trap&rdquo; by...

The Oliver Twins have been prominent members of the UK games industry since they shot to fame in the 80s for their much loved Dizzy series of games. I&rsquo;ve never met them myself, but everyone I know that has has nothing but glowing things to say about them - they&rsquo;ve been an immense help to many...

            <strong>News</strong> Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST. A small...

The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games.

This game has always struck me as an obvious candidate for an update, so it&rsquo;s good to hear it&rsquo;s finally happening. Development duties are being handled by Abstraction Games who most recently ported Hotline Miami to the PS3 an Vita. Fingers crossed it&rsquo;ll have been worth the wait. More...
