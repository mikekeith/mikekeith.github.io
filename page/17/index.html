            <strong>News</strong> Leading this month&rsquo;s news was US Gold&rsquo;s &ldquo;World Cup Carnival&rdquo;, the official World Cup &lsquo;86 game. A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

release and can now be pre-ordered. Earlier this year Colin ran a sadly
unsuccessful Kickstarter for it, so it&rsquo;s great to see this will indeed see the
light of day.</p>

            <strong>News</strong> Activision announced &ldquo;Murder on the Missippisic&quot;81, which was being written by Adam Bellin. Rather oddly C&amp;VG described Bellin as &ldquo;part of the team who produced the controversial &lsquo;Ghostbusters&rsquo;&rdquo;. I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...

            <strong>News</strong> One year and two months after Newsfield launched LM, the decision was made to end the experiment. Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The magazine had set out to cover &ldquo;every aspect of life&rdquo; for the youth audience, but was seen as being &ldquo;too widely targeted&rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy sales....

After finding success with Delta4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo; CRL had signed up the new St Brides spoof &ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure&rdquo;. Little of the much hyped &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo; had been heard over the previous few months, but now it had resurfaced with news that Beyond...

            <strong>News</strong> With yet more consolidation of software houses, Graeme Kidd painted a rather bleak outlook for innovative and original games. Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&rdquo; More tweaks were made to Crash&rsquo;s review process....
