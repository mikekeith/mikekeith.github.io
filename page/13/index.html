            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as...

            <strong>News</strong> May 28th would see Video Charity Day take place as part of the &ldquo;massive&rdquo; &lsquo;88 Telethon charity drive. Video rental customers would be &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; to donate while in video stores and there would be competitions and raffles. C&amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vixen&rdquo; was female &ldquo;doubly refreshing&rdquo;. The double part may have been a reference to the game&rsquo;s cover/advertisements which featured a photo...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore announced they were closing their Corby factory and ceasing the manufacture of the 64 in Britain. Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually solve? English Software were finally about to release &ldquo;Elektra Glide&rdquo; on the C64 - some months after...

            <strong>News</strong> The big buzz this month was the arrival of &ldquo;Xenon&rdquo; for the Amiga and ST which heralded the first true coin-op quality game on home computers. Electronic Arts were working on a graphic adventure for the Amiga called &ldquo;Return to Atlantis&rdquo;. Infocom were trying something a bit different with their Infocomix line of interactive comics. Rather than a typical adventure game, each issue would allow the reader to...

            <strong>News</strong> This month&rsquo;s editorial warned readers to expect some divisive reviews. Not divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some &ldquo;savage criticism&rdquo; was in store. One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered by the fact that a reader had written in to complain...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw Eugene Lacey take over as editor. Lacey came from editing Commodore User, and had been a C&amp;VG staff writer sometime earlier. Go!&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; promised arcade action featuring up to 18 aliens at any one time. Sega&rsquo;s Master System recently launched in the UK and now a slew of titles were heading its way. These included: &ldquo;Kung-Kid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fantasy Zone II&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Burner&rdquo;, &ldquo;Global Defense&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zaxxon 3D&rdquo;,...

Electric Dreams&rsquo; Spectrum port of &ldquo;Super Hang-On&rdquo; narrowly missed the review window for the month, but a tasty screenshot of it was included instead. C&amp;VG assured readers it was &ldquo;simply brilliant&rdquo;. The Edge was bringing comic cat &ldquo;Garfield&rdquo; to home computers. &ldquo;Crazy Cars&rdquo; was a rather promising looking 16bit racing game from Titus. &ldquo;Robocop&rdquo;...
