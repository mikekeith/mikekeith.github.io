            <strong>News</strong> Huge news arrived just hours before this issue went to press - Amstrad had bought Sinclair for meagre £5 million. What would this mean for Sinclair products? The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum. Overall it was taken as a positive happening, though the alternative would&rsquo;ve been receivership for Sinclair. Sir Clive himself was to return...

According to the site, not only is Deus Ex Machina 2 on the way, but also remakes of PiMania and even Thanatos. The latter is interesting seeing as I&rsquo;m pretty sure Croucher had nothing to do with the original. The original Deus Ex Machina was quite...

This all follows on from a pretty amazing interview with Rare in the previous issue of TGM - amazing because it was the first (and perhaps only?) proper interview conducted with the Stamper brothers.

            St Brides were easily one of those most intriguing software houses of the 80s. For a start they produced some great adventures games - &ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure&rdquo; was my first exposure to them, which I remember fondly. Their games were known for being well written with a keen sense of humour. Then there was the fact that they <em>appeared</em> to be a company consisting entirely of...

            Compared to the previous few months, there seemed like a relative dearth of good games released for the Spectrum. Crash pondered whether this had anything to do with the recent release of the Spectrum 128K. Game compilations (often tied to a charity) were coming out at a ridiculous rate - would this result in the cost of games for the consumer (typically kids) going down? or will the...

Last week the consistently excellent iOS developer Simogo released their latest game, &ldquo;Year Walk&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a highly atmospheric affair, rather beautiful yet sinister, that references various Swedish folk tales (the &ldquo;Year Walk&rdquo; itself being an old tradition). After a brief setup, the player is placed in a snowy landscape with no...
