      <description>There is a slight irony around my love of point &amp;amp; click adventures over the last few years. Back in the 8 and 16 bit days I would often pour my disdain on these games while proclaiming the superiority of the good old text adventure. I was willing to accept the static images that accompanied games like &amp;ldquo;The Guild of Thieves&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;The Boggit&amp;rdquo;, but controlling a pixeled character and clicking on things with a limited set of verbs?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a good time to be a retro gaming fan recently with several promising Kickstarters. Of course I dawdled too long on writing about them, so some have already finished, but they&amp;rsquo;re still worth keeping an eye on.&#xA;Reformation 2 from Matt Gray The first Reformation took a little longer to ship than originally expected, but it was well worth the wait. 5 CDs of excellent remakes of some of the best tunes to grace the C64 (and therefore, games in general).</description>

      <description>Following on from his beautiful C64 book, Sam Dyer is running a Kickstarter campaign to give the same loving treatment to the Amiga. He has an impressive list of prominent Amiga folk lined up as contributors and - quite rightly - plans to include a section on the demo scene, which played a huge role in making the machine so amazing. The campaign smashed through the initial goal within a short time but there are still some rather tasty looking stretch goals that would be great to hit.</description>
