            <strong>News</strong> News broke as the mag went to press that Commodore worldwide had basically filed for administration in the Bahamas, where the company was registered. Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move was obviously concerning, The One were...

TV show Gamesmaster was set to return for a second series and the production company were on the look out for young talent to take part.

            <strong>News</strong> Firebird closed a deal with Activision/Electric Dreams which would see the budget publisher re-releasing a slew of older titles from the US for £1.99 each. No changes at Zzap! this month, though Julian Rignall got engaged to Glenys Powell, the “ever-effervescent” Editorial Assistant. Zzap! launched in Italy. Note the lack of “64” - Speccy, Atari, MSX and C16 gamers would all be catered for. The Sensi Software lads...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw C&amp;VG getting a revamp based on reader feedback. Coin ops and consoles would get more pages, the adventure section got a make over, there was more space dedicated to previews and overall there would be a lot more colour. The announcement of these changes referenced the fact that some features were dropped, but they didn’t actually specify which. Somewhat worryingly, there were no adventure game...

            <strong>News</strong> Antony Jacobson wrote a withering attack on Zzap! and Crash in Computer Trade Weekly. It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &ldquo;&hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs. No-one forces them to publish contagious rubbish but magazines that do so are not simply to be described as boring, but debasing the values of their readership&hellip;...

London&rsquo;s The Museum of Mankind opened a new exhibit that made use of video discs and computers to create a game where visitors would learn what life in the Arctic was like.

Domark were producing &ldquo;Live and Let Die&rdquo;, a game based on Roger Moore&rsquo;s first Bond film. &ldquo;Barbarian II&rdquo; was due for release in August and promised a &ldquo;multiload extravaganza&rdquo; with a large, mappable area.

Rather oddly C&amp;VG described Bellin as &ldquo;part of the team who produced the controversial &lsquo;Ghostbusters&rsquo;&rdquo;. I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...
