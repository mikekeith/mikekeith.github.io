            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million.

The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

            <strong>News</strong> Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a reboot of Sinclair User&hellip; which made a little more sense. Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...

            <strong>News</strong> This was to be David Upchurch&rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&rsquo;s relaunch of&hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm. Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&rsquo;em up featuring...

            <strong>News</strong> Virgin snapped up Sensi&rsquo;s upcoming war game, &ldquo;Cannon Fodder&rdquo;. TV show Gamesmaster was set to return for a second series and the production company were on the look out for young talent to take part. DMI had signed a deal with German developer Prestige to bring their games to the UK. First up was &ldquo;Doofus&rdquo;, which would be followed by &ldquo;Sword of Honour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Catch&rsquo;em&rdquo;. Ocean were porting...

            <strong>News</strong> The transformation/infiltration/coup was complete and the team from ACE magazine had taken over reigns. The One for Amiga was now just &ldquo;The One&rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &ldquo;special interviews&rdquo; because the latter was &ldquo;simply more interesting&rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may...

Such a drastic move must&rsquo;ve been a bitter pill to swallow, but it did mean the return of Gary Whitta. TV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during...

            Well, this is rather fascinating: an Amiga 3000+ prototype board was sold on eBay by none other than Dave Haynie. It fetched a decent $2,155 USD and included a couple of his notebooks from the period when he was working on it. As if the fact that such a board still exists isn&rsquo;t interesting enough, he penned a long description of the board and what was going on at Commodore at...

            I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday. At any rate&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in...

This time rather than focussing on the British contribution to the industry, they&rsquo;re going to be talking to prominent Amiga developers, musicians, demo sceners and so on from around the world.

He has an impressive list of prominent Amiga folk lined up as contributors and - quite rightly - plans to include a section on the demo scene, which played a huge role in making the machine so amazing. The campaign smashed through the initial goal...

Development duties are being handled by Abstraction Games who most recently ported Hotline Miami to the PS3 an Vita. Fingers crossed it&rsquo;ll have been worth the wait. More...
