            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall (aka “Nutts”) joined the mag as Deputy Editor after having done five months hard time at ST Format. Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle since launch. The Voyage pack included “Microcosm” and “The Chaos Engine”, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for £299.99. Codemasters were bringing “Captain Dynamo” and the “Dizzy CD...

Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...

            <strong>News</strong> Team 17 were having another crack at the beat &rsquo;em up genre with &ldquo;Body Blows&rdquo;, along with a top down racer, &ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;. Rumours started to circulate that there was yet another Amiga model on the way: the A800. It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit between the A600 and the A1500. Commodore&rsquo;s Market Director Kelly Sumner was adamant there would be no machine...

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...

Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &ldquo;special interviews&rdquo; because the latter was &ldquo;simply more interesting&rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may...

It fetched a decent $2,155 USD and included a couple of his notebooks from the period when he was working on it. As if the fact that such a board still exists isn&rsquo;t interesting enough, he penned a long description of the board and what was going on at Commodore at...
