      <description>While the announcement of the SNES mini is hardly a surprise, especially given the runaway success of its 8bit sibling, the inclusion of Star Fox 2 certainly is. The sequel to arguably one of the finest games of the 16bit era was cancelled late into its development and never saw the light of day (aside from a leaked prototype ROM).
I missed out on the NES mini, mainly because I assumed that Nintendo would keep on churning them out for a good while, so I&amp;rsquo;m much more tempted this time around.</description>
