            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million.

The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

            <strong>News</strong> This was to be David Upchurch&rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&rsquo;s relaunch of&hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm. Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&rsquo;em up featuring...

            <strong>News</strong> Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga. Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &ldquo;Rebel Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&rdquo; to the CD32. (It didn&rsquo;t happen) While England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, Virgin were keen to...

            <strong>News</strong> Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting &ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo; to the Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation? It looked like &ldquo;The Second Samurai&rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration...

            <strong>News</strong> <strong>Ocean had scored a 1 hit last Christmas with ”WWF Wrestlemania”, and</strong> hoped for a repeat in the form of ”WWF European Rampage”. While the earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one would be better. Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming...

            <strong>News</strong> After months of mystery, Dino Dini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kick Off 3&rdquo; was finally unveiled. Unlike the second instalment which was effectively tweaks and improvements to the original&rsquo;s codebase, this one was re-coded from the ground up. Would it be able to take back the crown from &ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo; ? Speaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn&rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and &ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1&rdquo; was due out next month....

Rumours started to circulate that there was yet another Amiga model on the way: the A800. It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit between the A600 and the A1500.

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...

            <strong>News</strong> A new computer was about to be unleashed on Europe which boasted specs that certainly beat the 8bits, but also - apparently - rivaled the Amiga and ST. While that didn&rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th. With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to...

Were publishers simply holding them for Christmas? Judging by the slew of previews and announcements it certainly looked like there was plenty on the way. French developer Delphine were touting their new animation system, Cinematique. The first game to utilise it would be...

They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down.

            <strong>News</strong> Thanks to a tweet from Julian Rignall I finally noticed that the ships getting blown up by Zzap!64 on the cover represented Commodore User &amp; C&amp;VG. Cheeky. The reason for such a cover? Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed no signs of letting up. The mag would be undergoing a few changes - they looked to be broadening the scope of what they were covering,...

The former issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers. Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64. They...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw Eugene Lacey take over as editor. Lacey came from editing Commodore User, and had been a C&amp;VG staff writer sometime earlier. Go!&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; promised arcade action featuring up to 18 aliens at any one time. Sega&rsquo;s Master System recently launched in the UK and now a slew of titles were heading its way. These included: &ldquo;Kung-Kid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fantasy Zone II&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Burner&rdquo;, &ldquo;Global Defense&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zaxxon 3D&rdquo;,...

Electric Dreams&rsquo; Spectrum port of &ldquo;Super Hang-On&rdquo; narrowly missed the review window for the month, but a tasty screenshot of it was included instead. C&amp;VG assured readers it was &ldquo;simply brilliant&rdquo;. The Edge was bringing comic cat &ldquo;Garfield&rdquo; to home computers. &ldquo;Crazy Cars&rdquo; was a rather promising looking 16bit racing game from Titus. &ldquo;Robocop&rdquo;...

Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start). Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;, &ldquo;World Darts&rdquo; (may have become &ldquo;180&rdquo;), &ldquo;Night Racer&rdquo; and a...

A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw a new &ldquo;bigger and brighter&rdquo; look for TGM. Excitement was growing for the impending release of the Konix Slipstream megaconsole.

A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned...

The game certainly got the attention of the press but - unsurprisingly - for all the wrong reasons, as it turned out to be rubbish. (&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear&rdquo; lamented Crash in their review).

Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly...
