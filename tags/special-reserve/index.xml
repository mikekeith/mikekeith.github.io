      <description>As we bid goodbye to the 80s, the Editor pondered what lay ahead in the coming decade. After the world had lived in fear of nuclear annihalation for so many years, the arrival of the likes of Gorbachev meant we could now focus on the &amp;ldquo;prospect of irreversible doom&amp;rdquo; thanks to global warming. Technology would, of course, play a significant role in what was to come: &amp;ldquo;Our ability to manipulate information and communicate the results to the whole World within seconds, could lead us into chaos.</description>

      <description>While they didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal actual subscription figures, the situation sounded a bit grim - the membership fee was to increase and there was a plea for readers to spread the word.
Meanwhile the helpline seemed to have switched to be a largely answering machine based service, and there was a request for solutions to a bunch of big recent adventures.
In this issue:
The news included details of several upcoming adventures from Electronic Arts and Gary Gygax consulting for Infogrames on &amp;ldquo;Drakkhen&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In this issue you can find:
A bit of a rant by the Ed on the &amp;ldquo;joys&amp;rdquo; of running a software mail order service and dealing with clueless, impatient and down right rude customers calling up. A report from the first European Computer Trade Show, which sounded like a right disappointment: &amp;ldquo;Where were the First Ever Showings? The Exclusive Demos? The Sneako Previews? Well, they certainly weren&amp;rsquo;t present on the day I visited.</description>

      <description>Back in 1987 I ordered a copy of the classic adventure &amp;ldquo;Guild of Thieves&amp;rdquo; along with my Amiga 500. Included in the game&amp;rsquo;s package was a copy of &amp;ldquo;What Burglar?&amp;rdquo; magazine, and an advert for a mysterious &amp;ldquo;Confidential&amp;rdquo; club. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s how I remember it - looking through the box now I don&amp;rsquo;t see such an advert in there, though there is an offer to write in to Magnetic Scrolls to receive some swag.</description>
