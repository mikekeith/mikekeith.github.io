            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

            <strong>News</strong> Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga. Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &ldquo;Rebel Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&rdquo; to the CD32. (It didn&rsquo;t happen) While England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, Virgin were keen to...

The move cast doubts on whether there would be an official &ldquo;Kick Off 3&rdquo;, though co-designer Steve Screech remained at Anco.

            <strong>News</strong> Code Masters unveiled their fancy new CD compilations for the Spectrum and C64. The package included a computer interface to connect your regular CD player and the CD-ROM containing 30 Code Masters games. The Spectrum version was able to load games in under a minute, while the C64 utilised the stereo audio signal to encode a timing track enabling even quicker load times. C&amp;VG marvelled at the possibilities:...

            <strong>News</strong> Gary Penn responded to grumblings from readers about the Christmas issue. The main complaints were around the lack of reviews and the price. The former issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers. Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64. They...

            <strong>News</strong> This month&rsquo;s editorial warned readers to expect some divisive reviews. Not divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some &ldquo;savage criticism&rdquo; was in store. One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered by the fact that a reader had written in to complain...

Sega&rsquo;s Master System recently launched in the UK and now a slew of titles were heading its way.

Were game developers spending too much time and money on the licenses while neglecting the actual games? And was this just a temporary phase or would it become a trend? Crash made some changes to their review system: reviews would now be signed, and the rated categories were massaged...
