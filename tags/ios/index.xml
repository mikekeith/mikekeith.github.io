      <description>The iPad has become my preferred platform for playing adventure games, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to this one. I backed the Kickstarter almost three years ago and it&amp;rsquo;s been a treat to see it take shape - the dev blog posts and podcasts were worth it alone.&#xA;As luck would have it, my next overseas business trip is coming up in a few days which I hope will provide ample of opportunity to dive into it proper.</description>

I certainly remember playing it, but I also remember not really knowing what I was doing. It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat reminiscent of The Sentinel (surely a remake of that must be on the cards?), and features 9999 procedurally generated levels.&#xA;The original scored well in magazines of the day (Zzap! gave it 90%) and the remake is a decent job, though it feels a little rough and finicky - it seems to be a pretty straightforward port of the modern desktop version and the touch controls could use some love.</description>
