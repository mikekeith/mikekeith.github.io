      <description>Jeff Minter takes us through the first 7 levels of his upcoming PS4/PSVR shoot&amp;rsquo;em up, &amp;ldquo;Polyius&amp;rdquo;, and it looks as crazy full on as you might expect. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that he says people have reported they find it quite meditative as it&amp;rsquo;s all about the flow&amp;hellip; but even as a spectactor I found it tricky to follow. Will be interesting to see how much difference playing it in VR makes.</description>
