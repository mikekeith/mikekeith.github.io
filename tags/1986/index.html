            One of these days I’ll get my act together and not wait until the dying hours of the month (and even year in this case) to write these things… With that said, I did manage to have a decent play on a bunch of the biggest December games from 1986 and 1988. * * * !”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986 3116 ”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986 Reviewed Zzap!64 December 1986....

            <strong>News</strong> More changes were afoot, with Strategy Front writer Sean Masterson moving on and the start of a make over that would take effect during the next few months. Last month Zzap! teased readers by asking them to check out a screenshot of the hotly anticipated arcade conversion of &ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;&hellip; and then failed to print it. To make up for the error they provided not one but four shots....

            I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday. At any rate&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in...

            <strong>News</strong> Editor Gary Penn trumpeted the success of Zzap!, saying that it had become the &ldquo;biggest selling Commodore magazine in the civilised World.&rdquo; The healthy sales meant more advertisers, which meant more content - this month the mag hit 148 pages. A Commodore show took place in Manchester. Commodore did have a stand (which apparently bore a resemblance to Parisian public toilets), where they were showing off was the...

Mr Gathercoal firmly believed games were corrupting the minds of children, driving them to lives of robberies, killing and masturbation. He claimed that playing &ldquo;Franke Goes To Hollywood&rdquo; would lead to &ldquo;pill-popping&rdquo;. What utter nonsense.

There were three new faces with Richard &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Eddy, Jonathan Rignall (Julian&rsquo;s younger brother) and Massimo Valducci starting. Beyond announced the upcoming release of not one but two Denton Design games: &ldquo;Dante’s Inferno&rdquo; and &ldquo;Infodroid&rdquo;. Meanwhile, Beyond had managed...

So why weren&rsquo;t the crowds impressed with the show? It seemed software houses were very thin on the ground&hellip; Tony Takoushi was at the show touting a...

It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &ldquo;&hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs.

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore announced they were closing their Corby factory and ceasing the manufacture of the 64 in Britain. Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually solve? English Software were finally about to release &ldquo;Elektra Glide&rdquo; on the C64 - some months after...

Not divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some &ldquo;savage criticism&rdquo; was in store. One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered by the fact that a reader had written in to complain...

Beyond continued to promote their much hyped &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; game, which would never see a release. They also revealed &ldquo;Infodroid&rdquo; - a new game from Denton Designs.

A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

            <strong>News</strong> Andrew Braybrook revealed his new game, &ldquo;Uridium&rdquo;. It promised &ldquo;super- fast scrolling and authentically addictive action&rdquo; and would certainly end up delivering. Infocom slashed the prices on several of their games for a Christmas promotion. &ldquo;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide To The Galaxy&rdquo; would drop to £24.95, while others would be between £14 and £22. Two schoolboys raised £80 for famine relief in Ethiopia by playing games for 24 hours. The...

            <strong>News</strong> Dave Perry and Nick Jones had nearly wrapped up the latest Wally game for MikroGen - &ldquo;Three Weeks in Paradise&rdquo;. Domark released a screenshot of their rather controversial &ldquo;Friday the 13th&rdquo;. The game certainly got the attention of the press but - unsurprisingly - for all the wrong reasons, as it turned out to be rubbish. (&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear&rdquo; lamented Crash in their review).

While the event was usually held in the &ldquo;cavernous&rdquo; Royal Horticultural Hall, a booking mixup meant this one had to move to &ldquo;several rooms and various floors&rdquo; at Central Hall in Westminster. There were very few new products to talk about, the only ones receiving a mention being &ldquo;The Professional Adventure Writing System&rdquo;, a new disk...

The venue was the Camden Palace and plenty of gaming bigwigs were in attendance. Sadly the magazine failed to gain much traction, folding after only a handful of issues. The release of Amstrad&rsquo;s Spectrum +2 had many scratching their heads. Despite the official release having...

That number placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags. This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield,...

            <strong>News</strong> On the back of the news that the price of the Spectrum 128K had dropped following the acquisition by Amstrad, rumours started to circulate that a 256K &ldquo;games machine&rdquo; was in the pipeline. According to the rumours the machine would be Spectrum based but would use credit card sized &ldquo;cartridges&rdquo;. Reactions were mixed - while this would drastically reduce piracy, software houses feared Amstrad having control over what...

            <strong>News</strong> Huge news arrived just hours before this issue went to press - Amstrad had bought Sinclair for meagre £5 million. What would this mean for Sinclair products? The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum. Overall it was taken as a positive happening, though the alternative would&rsquo;ve been receivership for Sinclair. Sir Clive himself was to return...

            Compared to the previous few months, there seemed like a relative dearth of good games released for the Spectrum. Crash pondered whether this had anything to do with the recent release of the Spectrum 128K. Game compilations (often tied to a charity) were coming out at a ridiculous rate - would this result in the cost of games for the consumer (typically kids) going down? or will the...
