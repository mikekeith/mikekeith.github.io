            <strong>News</strong> Ariolasoft released a couple of screenshots from a new game which promised to be a &ldquo;totally interactive graphic adventure &lsquo;movie&rsquo;.&rdquo; The game, &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo;, received luke warm reviews, but it was notable in that it was one of those rarities at the time: a game developed behind the iron curtain. Activision were to take on EA&rsquo;s excellent &ldquo;Racing Destruction Set&rdquo; with their own racing game with a built...

            <strong>News</strong> Elite announced &ldquo;Scooby-Doo in the Castle Mystery&rdquo;, teasing gamers with a couple of amazing looking screens. It promised to provide cartoon like quality graphics but the game then promptly disappeared, only to resurface some time later as a very good, but very different game developed for Elite by Gargoyle Games. Christian Urqhart (programmer behind games like &ldquo;Daley Thompson&rsquo;s Decathlon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hunchback&rdquo;) had left Ocean and formed his own...

            <strong>News</strong> After months of teasing, the new look for C&amp;VG was here. It was quite a radical change and still looks pretty decent today. The excellent &ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo; was going to be re-launched by Silversoft and would feature new locations and graphics. Beyond struck a deal with Mindscape that would see its games distributed in the the US. First up were &ldquo;Lords of Midnight&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shadowfire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quake...

Both were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the music). Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&rsquo;s games in the US, they were strangely absent from UK shelves. This was about to change with &ldquo;Hypersports&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;Konami Tennis&rdquo;,...
