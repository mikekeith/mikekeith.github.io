      <description>In this issue&amp;hellip;
The editor reflected on 2 years of Special Reserve: memberships had shot passed 25,000, with 5,500 of those also subscribing to Official Secrets (and, therefore, Confidential). While there had been the usual summer lull in game sales, they were expecting a bumper Xmas due to the Amiga&amp;rsquo;s popularity and had decided to also carry Atari Lynx, Sega Megadrive and CDTV titles.
The news included details of SSI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Secret of Silver Blades&amp;rdquo;, a bunch of upcoming flight sims, Alexey Pajitnov&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tetris&amp;rdquo; followup &amp;ldquo;Welltris&amp;rdquo;, along with rumours of a new adventure from Level 9 (&amp;ldquo;Billy the Kid&amp;rdquo;), a game based on the book &amp;ldquo;Neuromancer&amp;rdquo;, and Sierra bringing &amp;ldquo;King&amp;rsquo;s Quest IV&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Colonel&amp;rsquo;s Bequest&amp;rdquo; to the Amiga.</description>

      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s editorial, The Boss Upstairs reflected on the success of the Special Reserve and Official Secrets clubs. The team had grown to 30 to cope with the increased orders, with some 200 being processed every day. The future looked bright.
Elsewhere in the mag:
A lengthy interview with Anita Sinclair of Magnetic Scrolls. The newest Special Reserve/Official Secrets team members were introduced. A back to basics primer on how to tackle adventure games.</description>

      <description>As we bid goodbye to the 80s, the Editor pondered what lay ahead in the coming decade. After the world had lived in fear of nuclear annihalation for so many years, the arrival of the likes of Gorbachev meant we could now focus on the &amp;ldquo;prospect of irreversible doom&amp;rdquo; thanks to global warming. Technology would, of course, play a significant role in what was to come: &amp;ldquo;Our ability to manipulate information and communicate the results to the whole World within seconds, could lead us into chaos.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s mag included:
A rather depressing Editorial which opened with &amp;ldquo;Boom-time for the computer games world is over, at least for the next few years.&amp;rdquo; The Japanese consoles were wiping the floor with computers - the 8bits were barely hanging on, the ST not far behind them. There looked to be some life left in the Amiga, but it was the IBM PC that stood the best chance of lasting.</description>

      <description>I guess this is a sign of how recent life has been all-consumed by work, but I only just noticed that Strand Games have released the second of their Magnetic Scrolls remasters, &amp;ldquo;The Guild of Thieves&amp;rdquo;.
There are few games which I remember as fondly as this, not just because it is a brilliant adventure (which it certainly is), but because it was the game - and only game - I ordered alongside my beloved Amiga 500.</description>

      <description>This issue came hot on the heels of British Telecom&amp;rsquo;s decision to bail out of the games industry. They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was rumoured to be around £5 million. The editorial questioned the motives, highlighting a series of recent misteps resulting in significant financial losses, which included the purchase of Beyond Software (closed down soon after due to poor performance), and the US based Firebird Licensees Inc which lasted less than a year.</description>

      <description>While digging through some boxes of old Stuff from the attic I came across a couple of solution books for the adventure games &amp;ldquo;Corruption&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Fish!&amp;rdquo; by Magnetic Scrolls. I got these directly from Magnetic Scrolls, and they&amp;rsquo;re far superior to regular old walkthroughs as they include location maps, hints for specific situations along with the step by step solutions.</description>

      <description>Back in 1987 I ordered a copy of the classic adventure &amp;ldquo;Guild of Thieves&amp;rdquo; along with my Amiga 500. Included in the game&amp;rsquo;s package was a copy of &amp;ldquo;What Burglar?&amp;rdquo; magazine, and an advert for a mysterious &amp;ldquo;Confidential&amp;rdquo; club. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s how I remember it - looking through the box now I don&amp;rsquo;t see such an advert in there, though there is an offer to write in to Magnetic Scrolls to receive some swag.</description>

      <title>The return of Magnetic Scrolls? (Sort of)</title>

      <description>Well, this is very interesting indeed. Hugh Steers - a founding member of Magnetic Scrolls - has formed Strand Games along with Stefan Meier (from if-legends.org). Their first release is a a remaster of the classic adventure &amp;ldquo;The Pawn&amp;rdquo;, available for Mac, Win and Linux. Not only that, but they have the support of other Magnetic Scrolls alumni, including Anita Sinclair and Ken Gordon.
I stumbled across their site somewhat randomly - I&amp;rsquo;m a bit surprised it hasn&amp;rsquo;t received more coverage in the retro gaming scene.</description>
