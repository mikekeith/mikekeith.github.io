            <strong>News</strong> Renegade&rsquo;s release schedule was looking rather impressive with “Uridium 2” first up, followed soon after by “Turrican 3” and “Elfmania”. If that wasn’t enough, “Ruff ‘n’ Tumble”, “Sensible World of Soccer”, “Flight of the Amazon Queen” and “Z”) were all due by the end of the year. The last one - a real time strategy game from the Bitmap Brothers - was particularly interesting since it’d be years...

            <strong>News</strong> The European Computer Entertainment show was on, then off, then back on. Editor Ciaran Brennan pondered the dearth of releases for this time of year. Were publishers simply holding them for Christmas? Judging by the slew of previews and announcements it certainly looked like there was plenty on the way. French developer Delphine were touting their new animation system, Cinematique. The first game to utilise it would be...

The much hyped Konix Multisystem was going to be available to buy this month at stores across the UK for around 200 quid. Not all of the eagerly anticipated peripherals would be on sale to start with - the hydraulic chair was &ldquo;on the horizon&rdquo; and expected to cost another 200 quid. Of course, sadly, none of...

Mr Gathercoal firmly believed games were corrupting the minds of children, driving them to lives of robberies, killing and masturbation. He claimed that playing &ldquo;Franke Goes To Hollywood&rdquo; would lead to &ldquo;pill-popping&rdquo;. What utter nonsense.
