      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s even designed by the original&amp;rsquo;s designer, Rick Dickinson!
After months of anticipation, the ZX Spectrum Next Kickstarter campaign has been launched. I was fortunate to see a prototype in action at the Revival Solstice event last July when Henrique gave a talk on the project and was very impressed. After some high profile crowdfunded retro gaming failures over the last couple of years it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be sceptical, but these guys are not only doing everything right, but all indications are that their hearts are in the right place too.</description>
