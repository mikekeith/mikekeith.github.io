      <description>Finally! I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this one for a while: &amp;ldquo;Full Throttle Remastered&amp;rdquo; has been released for iOS. The iPad has become my adventure gaming device of choice (aside from 8bit text adventures, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure out a solution for that), so it&amp;rsquo;s great to see another LucasArts classic on the platform.&#xA;Not only that, but to coincide with the release Double Fine have slashed the prices of &amp;ldquo;Grim Fandango Remastered&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Day of the Tentacle Remastered&amp;rdquo; - both highly recommended and absolute bargains at this price.</description>

      <description>The Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter was one of those few moments where you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re actually seeing a seismic shift in the industry. I jumped in within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games, particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to think twice. It&amp;rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride since then - the behind the scenes videos are the best accounts of game development ever committed to film, and I almost don&amp;rsquo;t want them to finish the game as that will mean the end of them.</description>
