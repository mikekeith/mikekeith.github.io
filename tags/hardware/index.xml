      <description>Updated with info about the remote control menu&#xA;I have a reasonable collection of C64s - 3 breadbins and 2 C64Cs - but out of those only two are fully functioning, so I&amp;rsquo;ve become quite aware that these machines are getting flakey in their old age. I&amp;rsquo;ve sunk quite a lot of hours into attempting to diagnose the faults and finding replacement bits online, with mixed success. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that I was eagerly awaiting the release of the C64 Reloaded mk2.</description>

      <description>Well, hot on the heels of yesterdays Ultimate-64 announcement comes the news that Individual Computers are about to start production of the C64 Reloaded Mk2. This is a rather different approach, and requires the user to install a few chips of their own in order to have a functioning C64. The required chips are:&#xA;CPU 6510 or 8500 Two CIA 6526 or 8521 Video chip 6567, 6569, 8565 or 8562 SID 6581 and/or 8580 The board supports a dual SID configuration.</description>

      <description>I received my 1541 Ultimate-II+ a couple of months ago and love it (which reminds me, I really need to do a write up of it), so the news that Gideon had announced a new product today certainly caught my attention.&#xA;The Ultimate-64 is a an FPGA implementation of the entire C64 board. This means it has all the ports of an original C64, so you can attach tape &amp;amp; disk drives and hook it up to your old Commodore monitors.</description>
