The editor reflected on 2 years of Special Reserve: memberships had shot passed 25,000, with 5,500 of those also subscribing to Official Secrets (and, therefore, Confidential). While there had been the usual summer lull in game sales, they were expecting a bumper Xmas due to the Amiga&rsquo;s popularity and had decided to also carry Atari Lynx, Sega Megadrive and CDTV titles.
The news included details of SSI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Secret of Silver Blades&rdquo;, a bunch of upcoming flight sims, Alexey Pajitnov&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tetris&rdquo; followup &ldquo;Welltris&rdquo;, along with rumours of a new adventure from Level 9 (&ldquo;Billy the Kid&rdquo;), a game based on the book &ldquo;Neuromancer&rdquo;, and Sierra bringing &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest IV&rdquo; and &ldquo;Colonel&rsquo;s Bequest&rdquo; to the Amiga.
