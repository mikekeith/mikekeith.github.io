            <strong>News</strong> Code Masters unveiled their fancy new CD compilations for the Spectrum and C64. The package included a computer interface to connect your regular CD player and the CD-ROM containing 30 Code Masters games. The Spectrum version was able to load games in under a minute, while the C64 utilised the stereo audio signal to encode a timing track enabling even quicker load times. C&amp;VG marvelled at the possibilities:...

            <strong>News</strong> Hot off the presses from Japan was news of the PC Engine Super Grafx which looked to build on the already impressive original. New custom chips meant it could chuck around 128 sprites (up from 64) and the cartridges saw a decent boost in size. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect was the Power Console add on which the console slotted into and featured a full on steering yoke,...

            <strong>News</strong> A new computer was about to be unleashed on Europe which boasted specs that certainly beat the 8bits, but also - apparently - rivaled the Amiga and ST. While that didn&rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th. With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to...

The much hyped Konix Multisystem was going to be available to buy this month at stores across the UK for around 200 quid. Not all of the eagerly anticipated peripherals would be on sale to start with - the hydraulic chair was &ldquo;on the horizon&rdquo; and expected to cost another 200 quid. Of course, sadly, none of...

            <strong>News</strong> Two years after it launched in the US, Atari were bringing the 7800 ProSystem to the UK. On paper the specs weren&rsquo;t up to much when compared to Nintendo and Sega&rsquo;s offerings, but at £69.95 it looked decent value for money. Stateside the 7800 was the number 2 selling console ahead of the Master System. Spectravideo&rsquo;s popular range of Quickshot joysticks (the Quickshot II Turbo was my personal...

Coin ops and consoles would get more pages, the adventure section got a make over, there was more space dedicated to previews and overall there would be a lot more colour. The announcement of these changes referenced the fact that some features were dropped, but they didn’t actually specify which. Somewhat worryingly, there were no adventure game...

            <strong>News</strong> Leading this month&rsquo;s news was US Gold&rsquo;s &ldquo;World Cup Carnival&rdquo;, the official World Cup &lsquo;86 game. A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

            <strong>News</strong> Activision announced &ldquo;Murder on the Missippisic&quot;81, which was being written by Adam Bellin. Rather oddly C&amp;VG described Bellin as &ldquo;part of the team who produced the controversial &lsquo;Ghostbusters&rsquo;&rdquo;. I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...

There had been hopes it&rsquo;d be out for Christmas, but it looks like licensing issues had pushed it back. Rhino announced &ldquo;Ark Pandora&rdquo; for the C64. PSS had released two new wargames: &ldquo;Falklands 82&rdquo; for the Spectrum and &ldquo;Theatre of Europe&rdquo; for the Amstrad.

Ultimate said that they were going to concentrate on making games and planned to release six new titles during 1986. What wasn&rsquo;t clear was just how involved the Stamper brothers were to be,...

Domark released a screenshot of their rather controversial &ldquo;Friday the 13th&rdquo;. The game certainly got the attention of the press but - unsurprisingly - for all the wrong reasons, as it turned out to be rubbish. (&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear&rdquo; lamented Crash in their review).
