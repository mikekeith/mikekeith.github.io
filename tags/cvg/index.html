            <strong>News</strong> Code Masters unveiled their fancy new CD compilations for the Spectrum and C64. The package included a computer interface to connect your regular CD player and the CD-ROM containing 30 Code Masters games. The Spectrum version was able to load games in under a minute, while the C64 utilised the stereo audio signal to encode a timing track enabling even quicker load times. C&amp;VG marvelled at the possibilities:...

            <strong>News</strong> Hot off the presses from Japan was news of the PC Engine Super Grafx which looked to build on the already impressive original. New custom chips meant it could chuck around 128 sprites (up from 64) and the cartridges saw a decent boost in size. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect was the Power Console add on which the console slotted into and featured a full on steering yoke,...

            <strong>News</strong> A new computer was about to be unleashed on Europe which boasted specs that certainly beat the 8bits, but also - apparently - rivaled the Amiga and ST. While that didn&rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th. With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to...

The much hyped Konix Multisystem was going to be available to buy this month at stores across the UK for around 200 quid. Not all of the eagerly anticipated peripherals would be on sale to start with - the hydraulic chair was &ldquo;on the horizon&rdquo; and expected to cost another 200 quid. Of course, sadly, none of...

On paper the specs weren&rsquo;t up to much when compared to Nintendo and Sega&rsquo;s offerings, but at £69.95 it looked decent value for money. Stateside the 7800 was the number 2 selling console ahead of the Master System. Spectravideo&rsquo;s popular range of Quickshot joysticks (the Quickshot II Turbo was my personal...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw C&amp;VG turn 5 years old and to celebrate they had a bunch of special features, including a Spectrum listing by Steve Turner&rsquo;s dad. Microsphere revealed their next game would be &ldquo;Contact Sam Cruise&rdquo;, which was inspired by classic private eye movies. There was also a hint that there might be something for fans of &ldquo;Skool Daze&rdquo; at Christmas. Arioalasoft got the licenses for two Hanna-Barbera...

First up from 39 Steps would be &ldquo;They Stole a Million&rdquo; while Reaktor&rsquo;s would be &ldquo;Deactivators&rdquo;.

The ambitious strategy/adventure (which was intended to have an optional Play By Mail service to allow players to compete with each other and Mike himself) had been in progress for a while and looked fantastic, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be until February 1988 that C&amp;VG finally got to play it.

A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...
