      <description>As I previously mentioned , a sequel the the amazing &amp;ldquo;Deus Ex Machina&amp;rdquo; is in the works. Well, Mel is now looking for backers to help fund the final stages of production. I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure of just how the game will turn out (the original was more about the experience as a whole, rather than they gameplay itself), but it cannot be overstated how important the original and Mel himself was to the early game scene.</description>

      <description>I have no idea how this managed to escape my attention for so long, but it appears Mel Croucher has relaunched Automata. According to the site, not only is Deus Ex Machina 2 on the way, but also remakes of PiMania and even Thanatos. The latter is interesting seeing as I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure Croucher had nothing to do with the original.&#xA;The original Deus Ex Machina was quite easily one of the most incredible game experiences I had during that time.</description>
