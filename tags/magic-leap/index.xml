      <description>When I made the decision to join Magic Leap back at the start of 2013, I told my friends that I had no idea where it was going to lead, but I knew it would be a ride&amp;hellip; and that it was.

Well, technically those of us in NZ entered into a &amp;ldquo;consultation&amp;rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a little break from looking back to the past and cast our gaze towards the tech of the present and future&amp;hellip;
Some (almost) 6 years ago I was approached to help out with a prototype Weta Workshop was developing with a highly secretive tech start up called Magic Leap. Workshop was well known, especially here in NZ, but there was little to no info out there about the latter.</description>
