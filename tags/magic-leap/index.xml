      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I made the decision to join Magic Leap back at the start of 2013, I told&#xA;my friends that I had no idea where it was going to lead, but I knew it would&#xA;be a ride&amp;hellip; and that it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s two weeks to the day that myself, my team here in NZ and over 1,000 of my&#xA;workmates at offices across the world were laid off. Well, technically those&#xA;of us in NZ entered into a &amp;ldquo;consultation&amp;rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by&#xA;NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant. It was a&#xA;sad end to what had been an intense (in good and bad ways) but incredible 7.5&#xA;years for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Workshop was well known, especially here in NZ, but there was little to&#xA;no info out there about the latter. Nevertheless it sounded intriguing and I&#xA;figured why not.. I was the first and - for 6 months - only programmer on the&#xA;project which would grow and transform over the coming years into &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20191026214025/https://www.magicleap.com/experiences/invaders&#34;&gt;Dr&#xA;Grordbort&amp;rsquo;s Invaders&lt;/a&gt;. I was also the first games industry person at&#xA;Magic Leap. Quite amazing to think how far things have come since those early&#xA;days. The NZ studio has grown to around 50 people, and my job entails very&#xA;little programming these days - we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to hire a bunch of far&#xA;more talented people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
