      <description>The Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter was one of those few moments where you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re actually seeing a seismic shift in the industry. I jumped in within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games, particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to think twice. It&amp;rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride since then - the behind the scenes videos are the best accounts of game development ever committed to film, and I almost don&amp;rsquo;t want them to finish the game as that will mean the end of them.</description>
