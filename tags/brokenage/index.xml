I jumped in&#xA;within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games,&#xA;particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to think twice.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride since then - the behind the scenes videos&#xA;are the best accounts of game development ever committed to film, and I almost&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t want them to finish the game as that will mean the end of them. Earlier&#xA;this week Double Fine released part 1 to the backers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.steampowered.com/app/232790/&#34;&gt;while opening up pre-&#xA;orders for everyone else&lt;/a&gt;. I started and finished the game over a period&#xA;of a few hours yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly quite short, which should come as no&#xA;surprise, but it really is a beautiful, charming game. At no point did it make&#xA;me feel stupid, and there were a number of genuinely funny bits. I hope it&#xA;sells absolute bucketloads so we can be treated to more games like this from&#xA;the talented folk at Double Fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
