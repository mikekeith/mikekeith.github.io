      <description>The iPad has become my preferred platform for playing adventure games, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to this one. I backed the Kickstarter almost three years ago and it&amp;rsquo;s been a treat to see it take shape - the dev blog posts and podcasts were worth it alone.
As luck would have it, my next overseas business trip is coming up in a few days which I hope will provide ample of opportunity to dive into it proper.</description>

      <description>While the announcement of the SNES mini is hardly a surprise, especially given the runaway success of its 8bit sibling, the inclusion of Star Fox 2 certainly is. The sequel to arguably one of the finest games of the 16bit era was cancelled late into its development and never saw the light of day (aside from a leaked prototype ROM).
I missed out on the NES mini, mainly because I assumed that Nintendo would keep on churning them out for a good while, so I&amp;rsquo;m much more tempted this time around.</description>

      <description>The site for the best retro gaming magazine out there (and, arguably, one of the finest gaming mags ever) has received a lick of fresh paint. It looks like they&amp;rsquo;ll be updating it more frequently with new articles, and emphasis on profiles (be they a game, old software house, retro hero or community member) should be interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been subscribing since around issue 15 (issue 123 has just been published!</description>
