            <strong>News</strong> Psygnosis announced &ldquo;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&rdquo;. This took a slightly different twist on the original, with the goal being to re-unite twelve tribes of Lemmings, each tribe having a different theme complete with their own abilities. An update to Sensi Software&rsquo;s smash hit &ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo; had arrived and boasted a bevy of new and improved features, including red &amp; yellow cards, the back pass rule and more competent...

            <strong>News</strong> <strong>Ocean had scored a 1 hit last Christmas with ”WWF Wrestlemania”, and</strong> hoped for a repeat in the form of ”WWF European Rampage”. While the earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one would be better. Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming...

            <strong>News</strong> Team 17 were having another crack at the beat &rsquo;em up genre with &ldquo;Body Blows&rdquo;, along with a top down racer, &ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;. Rumours started to circulate that there was yet another Amiga model on the way: the A800. It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit between the A600 and the A1500. Commodore&rsquo;s Market Director Kelly Sumner was adamant there would be no machine...

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...

Commodore continued their run of stupid business decision with the announcement that they were to stop selling the A500 Plus in favour of the new A600. The ‘92 Barcelona Olympics would soon be starting and Ocean was preparing “Espagna 92” sic to...

            <strong>News</strong> The transformation/infiltration/coup was complete and the team from ACE magazine had taken over reigns. The One for Amiga was now just &ldquo;The One&rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &ldquo;special interviews&rdquo; because the latter was &ldquo;simply more interesting&rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may...
