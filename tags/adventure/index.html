After the world had lived in fear of nuclear annihalation for so many years, the arrival of the likes of Gorbachev meant we could now focus on the &ldquo;prospect of irreversible doom&rdquo; thanks to global warming. Technology would, of course, play a...

Meanwhile the helpline seemed to have switched to be a largely answering machine based service, and there was a request for solutions to a bunch of big recent...

            This issue came hot on the heels of British Telecom&rsquo;s decision to bail out of the games industry. They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was...

            ! 3520 Way back in the mists of time (well, 1982) my parents took me and my sister out of school for a few months to embark on a trip around the UK, Europe and the US. For the European leg we jaunted about in a campervan, staying at campsites (and occasionally on roadsides) along the way. My memories of that time are sadly vague - my main recollection is...

            !3426 Well, this is very interesting indeed. Hugh Steers - a founding member of Magnetic Scrolls - has formed Strand Games along with Stefan Meier (from if-legends.org). Their first release is a a remaster of the classic adventure &ldquo;The Pawn&rdquo;, available for Mac, Win and Linux. Not only that, but they have the support of other Magnetic Scrolls alumni, including Anita Sinclair and Ken Gordon. I stumbled across their site somewhat...

            The Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter was one of those few moments where you feel like you&rsquo;re actually seeing a seismic shift in the industry. I jumped in within hours of the campaign going live - as a huge fan of adventure games, particularly those from Lucasfilm/Lucas Arts, I didn&rsquo;t need to think twice. It&rsquo;s been a really fascinating ride...

            St Brides were easily one of those most intriguing software houses of the 80s. For a start they produced some great adventures games - &ldquo;The Very Big Cave Adventure&rdquo; was my first exposure to them, which I remember fondly. Their games were known for being well written with a keen sense of humour. Then there was the fact that they <em>appeared</em> to be a company consisting entirely of...
