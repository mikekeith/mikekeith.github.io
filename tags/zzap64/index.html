Chris Wilkins, Roger Kean and Oli Frey have teamed up once again, this time to resurrect Crash&rsquo;s sister mag, Zzap!64, for an annual due out towards the end of the year. I must admit I didn&rsquo;t read the Kickstarter pitch or even watch the video before backing it as there was no question in my mind, so...

Phillipa Irving&rsquo;s war game section took a break as she was busy with exams. There was also a small change to the review format, with the &ldquo;Value&rdquo; rating being dropped.

            <strong>News</strong> Software Projects announced that they were reducing their prices to £5.95 in the run up to Christmas. Others were expected to follow suit, though that did seem somewhat unlikely as that’s a steep drop down from £9.95. Gary Penn pondered how lower prices might affect the quality of games - lower budgets for development? less licensed tie-ins? (The latter was considered a good thing) Ciaran Brennan was promoted...

            <strong>News</strong> Firebird closed a deal with Activision/Electric Dreams which would see the budget publisher re-releasing a slew of older titles from the US for £1.99 each. No changes at Zzap! this month, though Julian Rignall got engaged to Glenys Powell, the “ever-effervescent” Editorial Assistant. Zzap! launched in Italy. Note the lack of “64” - Speccy, Atari, MSX and C16 gamers would all be catered for. The Sensi Software lads...

            <strong>News</strong> Thanks to a tweet from Julian Rignall I finally noticed that the ships getting blown up by Zzap!64 on the cover represented Commodore User &amp; C&amp;VG. Cheeky. The reason for such a cover? Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed no signs of letting up. The mag would be undergoing a few changes - they looked to be broadening the scope of what they were covering,...

            <strong>News</strong> A couple of new arrivals at Zzap! this month, with Steve Jarratt swapping industrial chemistry for games journalism and Philipa Irving who, er, swapped Crash for its Newsfield sibling. Ariolasoft’s Starlight label had three games on the way. &ldquo;Dogfight 2187&rdquo; promised 3D wireframe shoot ‘em up action with a vertically split screen giving two views of the action. The other two games were &ldquo;Deathscape&rdquo; and &ldquo;Greyfell”. Meanwhile Tony...

            <strong>News</strong> Gary Penn wrote a long editorial on a matter that had been on a lot of people’s minds: had quality and innovation taken a dive as software houses relied more and more on coin-op, TV and film licenses? The market seemed to be full of these unimaginative and often shoddy tie ins which, aside from the attached IP, only had good presentation going for them. Developers were feeling...

            <strong>News</strong> Gary Penn responded to grumblings from readers about the Christmas issue. The main complaints were around the lack of reviews and the price. The former issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers. Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64. They...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Gary Penn lamented the fact that for the first time there had not been a single Sizzler or Gold Medal awarded in an issue. Well, that’s not entirely true as &ldquo;The Bard’s Tale&rdquo; picked up a very respectable Sizzler, though apparently it didn’t count as it was “a role playing game”. It seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before Christmas...

Last month Zzap! teased readers by asking them to check out a screenshot of the hotly anticipated arcade conversion of &ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;&hellip; and then failed to print it. To make up for the error they provided not one but four shots....

            <strong>Parallax</strong> <strong>Sensible Software/Ocean, 1986</strong> This month in 1986 saw Sensible&rsquo;s first big title reviewed in Zzap!64, scoring a very respectable 93% overall and receiving a Sizzler. Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve tried to remember where I first saw &ldquo;Parallax&rdquo;&hellip; I want to say it was at my friend Neil&rsquo;s house, but did he even have a...

            <strong>News</strong> An article appeared in the Canberra Times in which a Mr Paul Gathercoal blathered on about the evils of games. Mr Gathercoal firmly believed games were corrupting the minds of children, driving them to lives of robberies, killing and masturbation. He claimed that playing &ldquo;Franke Goes To Hollywood&rdquo; would lead to &ldquo;pill-popping&rdquo;. What utter nonsense. Gary Liddon had buggered off to Newsfield&rsquo;s new software house, Thalamus, and a...

There were three new faces with Richard &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Eddy, Jonathan Rignall (Julian&rsquo;s younger brother) and Massimo Valducci starting. Beyond announced the upcoming release of not one but two Denton Design games: &ldquo;Dante’s Inferno&rdquo; and &ldquo;Infodroid&rdquo;. Meanwhile, Beyond had managed...

The company was headed by ex-Activision Press Officer Andrew Wright. The first game was due to be released in September on the C64 and Spectrum, with an Amstrad version following. Gremlin were readying four new titles in time for Christmas: &ldquo;Pentacle&rdquo; (unreleased?), &ldquo;Future Knight&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bounder II&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trailblazer&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> The Commodore Show in London was the biggest dedicated C64 event of the year. Zzap!&rsquo;s own booth proved very popular - especially when games programmers dropped by to show off their latest wares (often yet to be signed to a publisher). So why weren&rsquo;t the crowds impressed with the show? It seemed software houses were very thin on the ground&hellip; Tony Takoushi was at the show touting a...

            <strong>News</strong> Antony Jacobson wrote a withering attack on Zzap! and Crash in Computer Trade Weekly. It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &ldquo;&hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs. No-one forces them to publish contagious rubbish but magazines that do so are not simply to be described as boring, but debasing the values of their readership&hellip;...

Sister publication Crash did even better, not only beating rival Sinclair User but also C&amp;VG, which meant it was the best selling computer title of any kind in the UK. In the same editorial, Roger Kean lamented the recent trend of game releases being pushed back. The common...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore announced they were closing their Corby factory and ceasing the manufacture of the 64 in Britain. Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually solve? English Software were finally about to release &ldquo;Elektra Glide&rdquo; on the C64 - some months after...

Not divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some &ldquo;savage criticism&rdquo; was in store. One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered by the fact that a reader had written in to complain...

            <strong>News</strong> Perhaps the biggest news for Zzap! readers this month was that Julian Rignall had left Newsfield to take up freelancing (including for rival publisher EMAP). Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start). Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;, &ldquo;World Darts&rdquo; (may have become &ldquo;180&rdquo;), &ldquo;Night Racer&rdquo; and a...

Up until this point Microprose&rsquo;s games had been distributed in the UK by US Gold, but now they were going to handle it all themselves. This would allow them to use much fancier packaging, for starters. Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations.
