David Morse (CEO of&#xA;Epyx, and one of the original Amiga hardware designers) was involved on what&#xA;was rumoured to be a new handheld. This, of course, would become the Atari&#xA;Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Megadrives and NES consoles started appearing in arcades in the UK where&#xA;players could purchase a set amount of play time with a range of games&#xA;available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nintendo seemed unphased by the&#xA;move, saying that they had never lost a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confusion reigned over the specifics for the Konix Slipstream. TGM attempted&#xA;to clear things up by confirming that it would retail at £150 (or slightly&#xA;higher), have a set of peripherals (hydraulic chair, light gun, 3D helmet),&#xA;some of which would be included with the console (not the chair!), and it&#xA;would use 3.5&amp;quot; floppies. TGM promised full coverage next month with a review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Costing a mere £149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would&#xA;be able to read software from standard 3&amp;quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks&#xA;were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce -&#xA;customers could look forward to paying only 15 quid for games. The CPU was&#xA;previously thought to be an 8086, but it was now revealed they were going with&#xA;a 68000. This would be accompanied by 4 customised co-processors and an&#xA;&amp;ldquo;extremely fast&amp;rdquo; (70 mips) blitter. Peripherals lined up for launch included&#xA;the hydraulic chair and 3D helmet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Neither the NES or Master System had managed&#xA;to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000&#xA;units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather&#xA;bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being&#xA;particularly enthusiastic about the Konix Slipstream: &amp;ldquo;I think Konix has the&#xA;potential to be another Amstrad. He [boss Wyn Holloway] has wreaked miracles.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;d expect the Slipstream to have an open road until 1990.&amp;rdquo; Of course, the&#xA;Konix never appeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&#xA;was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The&#xA;reception was luke warm at best: &amp;ldquo;is Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business&#xA;computer or a games machine that&amp;rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date&#xA;was to be January 28th and would include a bunch of add ons, including the&#xA;hydraulic chair. It was hard not to get caught up in the wave of hype for this&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The main one would be a &amp;ldquo;super ST&amp;rdquo; that would take on the Amiga,&#xA;then there was a portable ST, a &amp;ldquo;Pocket PC&amp;rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only&#xA;that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a&#xA;software bundle valued at £440. How many of these would actually hit the&#xA;selves?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A combination of a very&#xA;generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST&#xA;see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still&#xA;having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%.&#xA;Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small South Wales company called Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) was about to&#xA;release a Spectrum &amp;ldquo;super clone&amp;rdquo;. The SAM would feature 256K standard,&#xA;upgradeable to 512K. Retailers doubted whether it could make an impact, and so&#xA;it was only going to be available by mail order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle&#xA;for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine&#xA;but was now accepting that it&amp;rsquo;s destiny would be games.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sugar&amp;rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s Sky satellite TV&#xA;company which would see Amstrad producing and selling £199 dishes that would&#xA;receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following&#xA;year. Robert Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s BSB was also in the running, but had received some&#xA;scorn due to adopting an arguably superior format other than PAL meaning&#xA;separate dishes would be required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To mark the occasion, the Cyberpunk&#xA;theme would be visited several times in this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What was billed &amp;ldquo;the first mass-market desktop-publishing (DTP) packag&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo; was&#xA;launched by mouse manufacturer AMS for PC-XT and AT compatibles. It featured a&#xA;mouse, a handheld scanner and software - all for only £447.35&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was an attempt to bring &amp;ldquo;computer art&amp;rdquo; into the mainstream - not just graphics, but works using fabric etc. Elsewhere, Carnegie Mellon began a course on writing &amp;ldquo;interactive fiction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CRL&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2883&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wolfman&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was in the news for &lt;em&gt;failing&lt;/em&gt; to be slapped with a British Board of Censors rating certificate, unlike their previous adventures. This was apparently due to the game having &amp;ldquo;less animated&amp;rdquo; questionable material (animated being the key thing).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Palace Software announced a sequel to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=214&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barbarian&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=215&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Barbarian - The Dungeon of Drax&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the article was a mention that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2793&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Vixen&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; from Martech was about to be released (if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the connection was, it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Barbarain_II_cover_art.jpg&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Vixen1988.jpg&#34;&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-previews&#34;&gt;Notable Previews&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hewson announced their first foray onto the 16bits - a port of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1171&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zynaps&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a couple of 8bit games on the way: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1595&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Marauder&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1779&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Netherworld&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. There was mention of two other games - &amp;ldquo;Roadstar XRi&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Azimodious - Angel of Death&amp;rdquo; - but I don&amp;rsquo;t think they ever saw the light of day. Meanwhile there was speculation as to what Raffaele Cecco had up his sleeve for Christmas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1489&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Last Ninja II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; was nearing release, after a reported &amp;ldquo;8,000 man-hours of development and planning&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ocean had a couple of new coin-op conversions: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=803&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operation Wolf&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2740&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Typhoon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hard to believe it took so long to get a sequel, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001827&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Football Manager II&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by Addictive was about to be released. Speaking of which, Kevin Toms has been beavering away on a spanking brand &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20220110054844/https://blog.kevintoms.com/&#34;&gt;new version for iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1091&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Great Giana Sisters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had its release date set for July. This rather excellent game was soon pulled from the shelves after legal action by Nintendo.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Magnetic Scrolls&amp;rsquo; latest - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1557&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corruption&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; - was due to hit shelves in June. I have very fond memories playing this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The game that was the poster child for the Archimedes, &amp;ldquo;Zarch&amp;rdquo;, was finally coming to the Amiga and ST (under the name &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1361&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Virus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mel Croucher interviewed several industry folk on what things (specifically Big Brother related) would be like in 2001. Some quite amusing, slightly bonkers responses about government surveillance but, well, they weren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far off, were they?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To accompany Croucher&amp;rsquo;s look at the dark side of technology, there was a look at what games and game development might resemble in 2001. Lots of talk of RISC, parallel processing, transputers, realistic AI and so on. These articles always seem quaintly naive in retrospect, but it makes you appreciate how far you&amp;rsquo;ve come - and who knows what awaits in the near future. Remember that back then there was no publicly accessible Internet, and even laptops that you could use on your lap seemed like science fiction. Perhaps the most interesting theme of the piece for me was: technology isn&amp;rsquo;t entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continuing the whole &amp;ldquo;The Future!&amp;rdquo; theme, TGM went to the Ideal Home Exhibition to see the &amp;ldquo;Vision 2020 Home of the Future.&amp;rdquo; It was all rather silly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To round off this peek into the future, Mel Croucher went over the history of sound in games, and had some thoughts on what was in store.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The MSX-II had recently launched and the options (one from Sony and one from Philips) were examined. Promising, but never went anywhere in the West.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There was a &amp;ldquo;hard hitting&amp;rdquo; investigation into the alleged practice of software houses deliberately supplying pirates of games before they were released. Somewhat bizarrely, apart from the introduction, there was absolutely no further mention of this deliberate supply, but just that some developers were getting access to leaks from other companies to see what the competition was up to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;notable-reviews&#34;&gt;Notable Reviews&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=234&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carrier Command&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Realtime/Rainbird - ST 98% &amp;ldquo;Carrier Command is a seminal game destined to change the state of software and, as such, ranks alongside programs as Elite, Knight Lore, Flight Simulator 2 and The Hobbit&amp;hellip; In short, Rainbird have done it again, bringing us masterpiece of coding which will almost certainly be THE game of the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004087&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Target Renegade&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Imagine - Spectrum 85% &amp;ldquo;A distinct improvement over the original, the Spectrum game is a very good sequel - and tough - indeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002676&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Karnov&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Electric Dreams - Spectrum 88% &amp;ldquo;Should prove popular, with stacks of lasting appeal in nine tortuous levels and addictive action.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1139&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wizball&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; Ocean - ST 87% Amiga 84% &amp;ldquo;Although the games&amp;rsquo; structures remains identical to their 8-bit cousin, the ST and Amiga conversions have lost the fun element.&amp;rdquo; Too true - easily one of my biggest gaming disappointments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

This all&#xA;follows on from a pretty amazing interview with Rare in the previous issue of&#xA;TGM - amazing because it was the first (and perhaps only?) proper interview&#xA;conducted with the Stamper brothers. Everyone had been wondering what happened&#xA;to Ultimate Play The Game (arguably the finest developer of the 8bit years),&#xA;and now we all knew. Their arcade board would never see the light of day, but&#xA;I know someone who worked with it and it sounded rather tasty indeed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
