            <strong>News</strong> Word leaked out that Epyx was working on a new console. David Morse (CEO of Epyx, and one of the original Amiga hardware designers) was involved on what was rumoured to be a new handheld. This, of course, would become the Atari Lynx. Megadrives and NES consoles started appearing in arcades in the UK where players could purchase a set amount of play time with a range of...

            <strong>News</strong> Atari Games (not to be confused with hardware manufacturer, Atari) sued Nintendo for $100 million over the inability to publish games for the NES without going through the Japanese company. Nintendo seemed unphased by the move, saying that they had never lost a lawsuit. Confusion reigned over the specifics for the Konix Slipstream. TGM attempted to clear things up by confirming that it would retail at £150 (or...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw a new &ldquo;bigger and brighter&rdquo; look for TGM. Excitement was growing for the impending release of the Konix Slipstream megaconsole. Costing a mere £149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would be able to read software from standard 3&quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce - customers could...

            <strong>News</strong> The console wars were heating up as rumours surfaced that Nintendo and Sega were working on 16bit machines. Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly...

            <strong>News</strong> After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The reception was luke warm at best: &ldquo;is Amstrad&rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business computer or a games machine that&rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&rdquo; Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date was to be January 28th and would include a bunch...

            <strong>News</strong> Word on the street was that Atari was readying not one, but <em>four</em> new ST machines. The main one would be a &ldquo;super ST&rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a &ldquo;Pocket PC&rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many...

            <strong>News</strong> Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST. A small...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&rsquo;s price in line with the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games.
