            <strong>News</strong> While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a foothold in the European market.

therefore, Confidential). While there had been the usual summer lull in game
sales, they were expecting a bumper Xmas due to the Amiga&rsquo;s popularity and had
decided to also carry Atari Lynx, Sega Megadrive and CDTV titles.</p>

            <strong>News</strong> A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that Sierra On-Line were bringing &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest VI&rdquo; to our beloved machine. The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&rsquo;s Revolution which had created a hybrid of its &ldquo;Virtual Theatre&rdquo; system for the job to ensure the game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port. Krisalis spawned a new sub-label, Buzz,...

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...

            <strong>News</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly here&rdquo;, declared C&amp;VG about Mike Singleton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dark Sceptre&rdquo;. The ambitious strategy/adventure (which was intended to have an optional Play By Mail service to allow players to compete with each other and Mike himself) had been in progress for a while and looked fantastic, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be until February 1988 that C&amp;VG finally got to play it.

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&rsquo;s price in line with the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games. Sugar&rsquo;s Amstrad...

            <strong>News</strong> US Gold had signed the licenses to a couple of Disney games, &ldquo;Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood&rdquo; and &ldquo;Donald Duck&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo;. Both were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the music). Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&rsquo;s games in the US, they were strangely absent from UK shelves.
