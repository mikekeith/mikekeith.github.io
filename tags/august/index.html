            <strong>News</strong> While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a foothold in the European market. It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;. A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value...

The editor reflected on 2 years of Special Reserve: memberships had shot passed 25,000, with 5,500 of those also subscribing to Official Secrets (and, therefore, Confidential). While there had been the usual summer lull in game sales, they were expecting a bumper Xmas due to the Amiga&rsquo;s popularity and had decided to also carry Atari Lynx, Sega Megadrive and CDTV titles.
The news included details of SSI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Secret of Silver Blades&rdquo;, a bunch of upcoming flight sims, Alexey Pajitnov&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tetris&rdquo; followup &ldquo;Welltris&rdquo;, along with rumours of a new adventure from Level 9 (&ldquo;Billy the Kid&rdquo;), a game based on the book &ldquo;Neuromancer&rdquo;, and Sierra bringing &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest IV&rdquo; and &ldquo;Colonel&rsquo;s Bequest&rdquo; to the Amiga.

            <strong>News</strong> A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that Sierra On-Line were bringing &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest VI&rdquo; to our beloved machine. The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&rsquo;s Revolution which had created a hybrid of its &ldquo;Virtual Theatre&rdquo; system for the job to ensure the game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port. Krisalis spawned a new sub-label, Buzz,...

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...

There looked to be some life left in the Amiga,...

            <strong>News</strong> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly here&rdquo;, declared C&amp;VG about Mike Singleton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dark Sceptre&rdquo;. The ambitious strategy/adventure (which was intended to have an optional Play By Mail service to allow players to compete with each other and Mike himself) had been in progress for a while and looked fantastic, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be until February 1988 that C&amp;VG finally got to play it. From the review: &ldquo;Was it worth the wait? We&rsquo;ll...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&rsquo;s price in line with the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games. Sugar&rsquo;s Amstrad...
