            <strong>News</strong> While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a foothold in the European market. It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that Sierra On-Line were bringing &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest VI&rdquo; to our beloved machine. The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&rsquo;s Revolution which had created a hybrid of its &ldquo;Virtual Theatre&rdquo; system for the job to ensure the game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port. Krisalis spawned a new sub-label, Buzz,...

            <strong>News</strong> Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &ldquo;Hostile Breed&rdquo;...
