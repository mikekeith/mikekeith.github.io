            <strong>News</strong> Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

            <strong>News</strong> Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting &ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo; to the Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation? It looked like &ldquo;The Second Samurai&rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration...

The first up was a &ldquo;pseudo-sequel&rdquo; to &ldquo;Epic&rdquo; - called &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; - set 90 years further in the future and would feature more of an open world feel. Sadly it looks like it was never released.. The second was another sequel, jet fighter sim &ldquo;TFX Inferno&rdquo;. Relative newcomer Miracle Games were rather bullish about their upcoming platformer, &ldquo;Miracle...

            As we bid goodbye to the 80s, the Editor pondered what lay ahead in the coming decade. After the world had lived in fear of nuclear annihalation for so many years, the arrival of the likes of Gorbachev meant we could now focus on the &ldquo;prospect of irreversible doom&rdquo; thanks to global warming. Technology would, of course, play a...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Gary Penn lamented the fact that for the first time there had not been a single Sizzler or Gold Medal awarded in an issue. Well, that’s not entirely true as &ldquo;The Bard’s Tale&rdquo; picked up a very respectable Sizzler, though apparently it didn’t count as it was “a role playing game”. It seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before Christmas...

They described it as a “neat little gizmo” but I can’t imagine it being anything other than dreadful. The Amiga, ST and Amstrad versions of Titus’ car racing game &ldquo;Crazy Cars II&rdquo; were on the shelves, with the C64 due this month. German...
