            <strong>News</strong> While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a “buying show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left...

            <strong>News</strong> After reporting that the saga of Commodore&rsquo;s fate would be resolved &ldquo;any day now&rdquo; for the past few months, The One decided to quit guessing the timeline. In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen. At the US head office Mehdi Ali was officially...

It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;. A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value...

The &ldquo;most solid&rdquo; information pointed to a &ldquo;Far-Eastern&rdquo; company, with Acer, Samsung and Goldstar all rumoured to be in the running.

Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move was obviously concerning, The One were...

Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle since launch. The Voyage pack included “Microcosm” and “The Chaos Engine”, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for £299.99. Codemasters were bringing “Captain Dynamo” and the “Dizzy CD...

Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...
