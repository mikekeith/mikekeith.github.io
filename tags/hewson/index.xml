      <description>Andrew Hewson is running a Kickstarter for a new book detailing his experiences and insights from a long career in videogame development. I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly keen on the title of the book (&amp;ldquo;Hints &amp;amp; Tips for Videogame Pioneers&amp;rdquo;) as it sounds a bit like those &amp;ldquo;Learn how to program C++ in 24 hours!&amp;rdquo; books, but I would love to read his accounts of what was one my favourite software houses of the 80s/90s.</description>
