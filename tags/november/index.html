            <strong>News</strong> The CD32 launch hadn&rsquo;t exactly gotten off to a great start, with sales looking rather lacklustre. To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &lsquo;93 exhibition and an upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &lsquo;93 was such a big hit that...

            <strong>News</strong> <strong>Ocean had scored a 1 hit last Christmas with ”WWF Wrestlemania”, and</strong> hoped for a repeat in the form of ”WWF European Rampage”. While the earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one would be better. Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming...

            <strong>News</strong> A new computer was about to be unleashed on Europe which boasted specs that certainly beat the 8bits, but also - apparently - rivaled the Amiga and ST. While that didn&rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th. With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to...

            I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday. At any rate&hellip; Here&rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in...

A Commodore show took place in Manchester. Commodore did have a stand (which apparently bore a resemblance to Parisian public toilets), where they were showing off was the...

Early indications were that Batman had the edge. Loricel&rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche racing game &ldquo;944 Turbo Cup&rdquo;. Driver Rene Metge (&ldquo;who?&rdquo; asked C&amp;VG) provided the endorsement and the software house hoped to include a model...
