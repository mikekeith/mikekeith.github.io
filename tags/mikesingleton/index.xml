      <description>Chris Wild, who was behind the excellent iOS remake of &amp;ldquo;Lords of Midnight&amp;rdquo;, has announced that his company is now taking on a brand new version of another Mike Singleton classic: &amp;ldquo;Midwinter&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Midwinter&amp;rdquo; received considerable critical claim but slipped by unnoticed by many (including myself). A sprawling open world game originally released on the Amiga in 1989, &amp;ldquo;Midwinter&amp;rdquo; was an early, influential example of sandbox gameplay.&#xA;The game is currently in pre-production, with a Kickstarter campaign expected to start in the next few months.</description>
