            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

            <strong>News</strong> The One had had a bit of a facelift with the Contents page getting a re- design, along with various sections getting re-labelled. The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall (aka “Nutts”) joined the mag as Deputy Editor after having done five months hard time at ST Format. Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle since launch. The Voyage pack included “Microcosm” and “The Chaos Engine”, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for £299.99. Codemasters were bringing “Captain Dynamo” and the “Dizzy CD...

            <strong>News</strong> The transformation/infiltration/coup was complete and the team from ACE magazine had taken over reigns. The One for Amiga was now just &ldquo;The One&rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &ldquo;special interviews&rdquo; because the latter was &ldquo;simply more interesting&rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may...

            This issue came hot on the heels of British Telecom&rsquo;s decision to bail out of the games industry. They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was...

            <strong>News</strong> Thanks to a tweet from Julian Rignall I finally noticed that the ships getting blown up by Zzap!64 on the cover represented Commodore User &amp; C&amp;VG. Cheeky. The reason for such a cover? Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed no signs of letting up. The mag would be undergoing a few changes - they looked to be broadening the scope of what they were covering,...

            <strong>News</strong> More changes at Crash towers this month with three new staff members: Ian Phillipson, Gareth Adams and, perhaps most notably, Ciaran Brennan.

            <strong>News</strong> Huge news arrived just hours before this issue went to press - Amstrad had bought Sinclair for meagre £5 million. What would this mean for Sinclair products? The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum.

The &ldquo;Designer of the Month&rdquo; was Stephen Redman, a 21 year old uni student who released the somewhat controversial (how innocent we...
