      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this&#xA;series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I&#xA;knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but&#xA;what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another,&#xA;longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a&#xA;single weekend. Work-wise it was a very productive and beneficial time, but it&#xA;did mean that other things slipped through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wait,&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t walk away! It&amp;rsquo;ll get better, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various&#xA;points I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my&#xA;spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made&#xA;it through to the end and even that took way too long. The reasons for the&#xA;slow/non-existent progress have typically revolved around being swamped with&#xA;work, being overly ambitious and getting distracted by new shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
