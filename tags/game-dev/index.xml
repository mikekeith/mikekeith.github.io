      <description>Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another, longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a single weekend.</description>

      <description>Here is the first screenshot of a new game I&amp;rsquo;m working on - awesome eh? Wait, don&amp;rsquo;t walk away! It&amp;rsquo;ll get better, I promise!
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various points I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made it through to the end and even that took way too long.</description>
