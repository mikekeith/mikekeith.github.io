      <description>News Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &amp;ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&amp;rdquo;.
A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.
Retailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a new CD32 bundle.</description>

      <description>News Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role.
If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said, apparently 82% of stores surveyed were keen to continue selling the machines (if they were provided some to sell&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>News Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t without its price, tho: &amp;ldquo;So, it&amp;rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&amp;rdquo;
The fate of Commodore remained up in the air, with little news to be had.</description>

      <description>News While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a “buying show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left to purchase by then.</description>

      <description>News Editor Simon Byron announced he was stepping down to work at a chip shop on the outskirts of Bognor: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that the life of a simple chippy is preferable to slogging my guts out on Britain&amp;rsquo;s least popular Amiga games magazine.&amp;rdquo; Andy Nuttall would be filling in as Acting Editor.
Frustrating times for Amiga journos and fans alike as there was still no news from Commodore on the future of the company.</description>

      <description>News After reporting that the saga of Commodore&amp;rsquo;s fate would be resolved &amp;ldquo;any day now&amp;rdquo; for the past few months, The One decided to quit guessing the timeline. In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen. At the US head office Mehdi Ali was officially out.</description>

News While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a foothold in the European market. It seemed everything was hanging on that deal.
Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &amp;ldquo;Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo;.
A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value in 1993 was £670 million compared to £700 million in 1992.</description>

      <description>News The fate of Commodore UK was close to becoming a bit clearer with an announcement regarding a new owner was due &amp;ldquo;any day now&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;most solid&amp;rdquo; information pointed to a &amp;ldquo;Far-Eastern&amp;rdquo; company, with Acer, Samsung and Goldstar all rumoured to be in the running. While the UK office had continued trading, they weren&amp;rsquo;t receiving any new units to sell which meant they had to make do with whatever stock they had in their warehouses.</description>

      <description>News News broke as the mag went to press that Commodore worldwide had basically filed for administration in the Bahamas, where the company was registered. Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move was obviously concerning, The One were confident that the continued popularity of the Amiga would mean a positive outcome one way or another.</description>

      <description>News Andy Nuttall (aka “Nutts”) joined the mag as Deputy Editor after having done five months hard time at ST Format.
Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle since launch. The Voyage pack included “Microcosm” and “The Chaos Engine”, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for £299.99.
Codemasters were bringing “Captain Dynamo” and the “Dizzy CD Collection” to the CD32.</description>

      <description>News Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a reboot of Sinclair User&amp;hellip; which made a little more sense.
Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind Snooker”, “Archer Maclean’s Pool”, “Realms”, “Legend of Kyrandia”, “Supremacy”, “KGB”, “Reach for the Skies”, “Shuttle” and “Lure of the Temptress”.</description>

News This was to be David Upchurch&amp;rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&amp;rsquo;s relaunch of&amp;hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm.
Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &amp;ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&amp;rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&amp;rsquo;em up featuring new AGA backdrops, digitised speech and a digital CD soundtrack.</description>

      <description>News Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga.
Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &amp;ldquo;Rebel Assault&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&amp;rdquo; to the CD32. (It didn&amp;rsquo;t happen)
While England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, Virgin were keen to join with Adidas to sponsor a new initiative to promote youth footballing skills.</description>

      <description>News Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting &amp;ldquo;Sim City 2000&amp;rdquo; to the Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation?
It looked like &amp;ldquo;The Second Samurai&amp;rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&amp;rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration work be finished before a single line of code was written.</description>

      <description>News Editor David Upchurch had “deserted” the mag for a couple of months which left Simon Byron in charge.
The CD32 received some encouraging news as high street retailer Menzies announced they would be stocking it in time for Christmas.
After some months of silence (on the Amiga at any rate), Thalamus was about to release “S.U.B.” (unreleased). The One wondered what had happened to “Arsenal” - rumour was the programmer had gone missing&amp;hellip; It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see the light of day.</description>

      <description>News The CD32 launch hadn&amp;rsquo;t exactly gotten off to a great start, with sales looking rather lacklustre. To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &amp;lsquo;93 exhibition and an upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &amp;lsquo;93 was such a big hit that Commodore had already booked its presence at next year&amp;rsquo;s event.</description>

      <description>News Renegade&amp;rsquo;s release schedule was looking rather impressive with “Uridium 2” first up, followed soon after by “Turrican 3” and “Elfmania”. If that wasn’t enough, “Ruff ‘n’ Tumble”, “Sensible World of Soccer”, “Flight of the Amazon Queen” and “Z”) were all due by the end of the year. The last one - a real time strategy game from the Bitmap Brothers - was particularly interesting since it’d be years before it saw the light of day.</description>

      <description>News In an effort to draw some attention away from the other popular gaming mascots, Mindscape decided to enter &amp;ldquo;Alfred the Chicken&amp;rdquo; in the Christchurch by-election. Alfred managed to bring in 18 votes - two ahead of the Rainbow Alliance Party. The resulting media &amp;ldquo;circus&amp;rdquo; was certainly worth the 500 quid it cost them.

      <description>News A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that Sierra On-Line were bringing &amp;ldquo;King&amp;rsquo;s Quest VI&amp;rdquo; to our beloved machine. The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&amp;rsquo;s Revolution which had created a hybrid of its &amp;ldquo;Virtual Theatre&amp;rdquo; system for the job to ensure the game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port.

It transpired that his involvement came about after he contacted The One to complain they&amp;rsquo;d forgotten to credit him for &amp;ldquo;Watchmen&amp;rdquo;. The mag decided to lend him an Amiga and a copy of &amp;ldquo;Deluxe Paint&amp;rdquo; for a followup article, which sparked his interest in computer art and lead to an introduction to Cecil.</description>

      <description>News Digital Image Design had two new titles on the way. The first up was a &amp;ldquo;pseudo-sequel&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo; - called &amp;ldquo;Odyssey&amp;rdquo; - set 90 years further in the future and would feature more of an open world feel. Sadly it looks like it was never released.. The second was another sequel, jet fighter sim &amp;ldquo;TFX Inferno&amp;rdquo;.
Relative newcomer Miracle Games were rather bullish about their upcoming platformer, &amp;ldquo;Miracle Bat&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Psygnosis announced &amp;ldquo;Lemmings 2: The Tribes&amp;rdquo;. This took a slightly different twist on the original, with the goal being to re-unite twelve tribes of Lemmings, each tribe having a different theme complete with their own abilities.
An update to Sensi Software&amp;rsquo;s smash hit &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo; had arrived and boasted a bevy of new and improved features, including red &amp;amp; yellow cards, the back pass rule and more competent goalies.</description>

      <description>News Ocean had scored a #1 hit last Christmas with ”WWF Wrestlemania”, and hoped for a repeat in the form of ”WWF European Rampage”. While the earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one would be better.
Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming machine and right as the mag went to press it looked like they had news&amp;hellip; though that would have to wait until next month.</description>

      <description>News After months of mystery, Dino Dini&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Kick Off 3&amp;rdquo; was finally unveiled. Unlike the second instalment which was effectively tweaks and improvements to the original&amp;rsquo;s codebase, this one was re-coded from the ground up. Would it be able to take back the crown from &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo; ?
Speaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn&amp;rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1&amp;rdquo; was due out next month. Player and club data had been updated for the new season, and there were other welcome changes such as re-written goalie behaviour.</description>

      <description>News Team 17 were having another crack at the beat &amp;rsquo;em up genre with &amp;ldquo;Body Blows&amp;rdquo;, along with a top down racer, &amp;ldquo;Overdrive&amp;rdquo;.
Rumours started to circulate that there was yet another Amiga model on the way: the A800. It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit between the A600 and the A1500. Commodore&amp;rsquo;s Market Director Kelly Sumner was adamant there would be no machine called the A800, but did confirm there was another machine on the way&amp;hellip; I assume it was the A1200.</description>

      <description>News Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &amp;ldquo;Barbarian&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Shoot&amp;rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&amp;rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&amp;rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &amp;ldquo;Hostile Breed&amp;rdquo; (unreleased, but was actually finished and reviewed two issues earlier), and &amp;ldquo;Super Barbarian&amp;rdquo; (also unreleased).</description>

      <description>News The upcoming Christmas battle for number one looked to be between Konami’s “Batman Returns”, Acclaim’s “Alien 3” and Ocean’s latest movie license signing: “Lethal Weapon 3”.
Commodore continued their run of stupid business decision with the announcement that they were to stop selling the A500 Plus in favour of the new A600.
The ‘92 Barcelona Olympics would soon be starting and Ocean was preparing “Espagna 92” [sic] to take on US Gold’s “Megasports”.</description>

DMI had signed a deal with German developer Prestige to bring their games to the UK. First up was &amp;ldquo;Doofus&amp;rdquo;, which would be followed by &amp;ldquo;Sword of Honour&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Catch&amp;rsquo;em&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>News The transformation/infiltration/coup was complete and the team from ACE magazine had taken over reigns. The One for Amiga was now just &amp;ldquo;The One&amp;rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &amp;ldquo;special interviews&amp;rdquo; because the latter was &amp;ldquo;simply more interesting&amp;rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may have gone a little easy on games).</description>

      <description>News It seemed this would be the final issue for the whole editorial crew as they were being replaced by the folk from &amp;ldquo;ex-sister magazine ACE&amp;rdquo;. Such a drastic move must&amp;rsquo;ve been a bitter pill to swallow, but it did mean the return of Gary Whitta.
TV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during its first season.</description>

      <description>News The European Computer Entertainment show was on, then off, then back on.
Editor Ciaran Brennan pondered the dearth of releases for this time of year. Were publishers simply holding them for Christmas? Judging by the slew of previews and announcements it certainly looked like there was plenty on the way.
French developer Delphine were touting their new animation system, Cinematique. The first game to utilise it would be &amp;ldquo;Another World&amp;rdquo;.</description>
