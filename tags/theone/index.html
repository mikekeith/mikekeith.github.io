            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

            <strong>News</strong> Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen.

It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;. A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value...

            <strong>News</strong> This was to be David Upchurch&rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&rsquo;s relaunch of&hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm. Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&rsquo;em up featuring...

            <strong>News</strong> Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga. Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &ldquo;Rebel Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&rdquo; to the CD32.

It looked like &ldquo;The Second Samurai&rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming.

            <strong>News</strong> Digital Image Design had two new titles on the way. The first up was a &ldquo;pseudo-sequel&rdquo; to &ldquo;Epic&rdquo; - called &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; - set 90 years further in the future and would feature more of an open world feel.

Relative newcomer Miracle Games were rather bullish about their upcoming platformer, &ldquo;Miracle...
