      <description>Issue 168 of Retro Gamer (May-ish 2017 - my copy didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive until a week or so into June) has a great article on the &amp;ldquo;Rogue Squadron&amp;rdquo; series of games, complete with a few ramblings from myself. The other people interviewed were my old Factor 5 colleagues Julian Eggebrecht, Jamie Uhrmacher and Chris Crawford, plus Ryan Kaufman who was a level designer at Lucasarts.
I joined Factor 5 soon after &amp;ldquo;Rogue Squadron&amp;rdquo; had been released, and my first game there would be the sadly underrated and somewhat unknown &amp;ldquo;Battle for Naboo&amp;rdquo; - the fact that it was an Episode 1 game right after Star Wars fans worldwide had been punched in the guts by that terrible movie didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description>
