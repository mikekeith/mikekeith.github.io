      <description>The remake of &amp;ldquo;Slightly Magic&amp;rdquo; by Colin Jones is almost ready for release and can now be pre-ordered. Earlier this year Colin ran a sadly unsuccessful Kickstarter for it, so it&amp;rsquo;s great to see this will indeed see the light of day.
The game features the original&amp;rsquo;s graphics and a remastered soundtrack by Allister Brimble.</description>

      <description>Colin Jones is probably best known for his excellent rock star management simulation, &amp;ldquo;Rock Star Ate My Hamster&amp;rdquo;, which featured many thinly veiled (rather biting) pop culture references. &amp;ldquo;Slightly Magic&amp;rdquo; was a later creation of his which was always intended to be part of a trilogy of games, but sadly the latter two chapters were never released. Colin is now hoping to resurrect Slightly, starting with an updated version of &amp;ldquo;Slightly Magic&amp;rdquo; followed by two new games to complete the series.</description>
