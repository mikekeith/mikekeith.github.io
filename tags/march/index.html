The market seemed to be full of these unimaginative and often shoddy tie ins which, aside from the attached IP, only had good presentation going for them. Developers were feeling...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore announced they were closing their Corby factory and ceasing the manufacture of the 64 in Britain. Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually solve? English Software were finally about to release &ldquo;Elektra Glide&rdquo; on the C64 - some months after...

Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&rdquo; More tweaks were made to Crash&rsquo;s review process....
