      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s issue&amp;hellip;&#xA;The subject on the editor&amp;rsquo;s mind was, perhaps unexpectedly for an adventure gaming mag, taxation as he had a good rant about how much money from each game the club sold went to the HMRC.&#xA;Games making the news this month included several horror games (&amp;ldquo;Elvira&amp;rdquo;, [&amp;ldquo;Demon&amp;rsquo;s Tomb - The Awakening&amp;rdquo;][4403], [&amp;ldquo;Mystery of the Mummy&amp;rdquo;][4404]), the next title from The Bitmaps in the form of [&amp;ldquo;Cadaver&amp;rdquo;][4405], and some new games from Origin.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s mag included:&#xA;A rather depressing Editorial which opened with &amp;ldquo;Boom-time for the computer games world is over, at least for the next few years.&amp;rdquo; The Japanese consoles were wiping the floor with computers - the 8bits were barely hanging on, the ST not far behind them. There looked to be some life left in the Amiga, but it was the IBM PC that stood the best chance of lasting.</description>

The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was rumoured to be around £5 million. The editorial questioned the motives, highlighting a series of recent misteps resulting in significant financial losses, which included the purchase of Beyond Software (closed down soon after due to poor performance), and the US based Firebird Licensees Inc which lasted less than a year.</description>
