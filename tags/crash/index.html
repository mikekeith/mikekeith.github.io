            ! 3653 The Kickstarter for the 99th issue of Crash magazine has gone live. Roger Kean is back on editing duties, and Oli Frey will be creating the cover and art - we&rsquo;ll even see the return of the Jetman comic strip. The line up of other contributors is also looking rather impressive. Crash holds a special place in my heart - it was my main go to mag back...

            <strong>News</strong> One year and two months after Newsfield launched LM, the decision was made to end the experiment. Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The magazine had set out to cover &ldquo;every aspect of life&rdquo; for the youth audience, but was seen as being &ldquo;too widely targeted&rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy sales....

            <strong>News</strong> More changes at Crash towers this month with three new staff members: Ian Phillipson, Gareth Adams and, perhaps most notably, Ciaran Brennan. Mastertronic was branching out into the video and music markets by launching the Master Vision and Master Sound labels. The Tau Ceti system was to once again be the setting for a new game from CRL called &ldquo;Traxxion&rdquo;. Piracy was rife in the USSR with the...

Graeme Kidd was now to be editor of the ill fated LM magazine. Spring had arrived and there were a slew of announcements by software houses of upcoming games. Some of the notable...

            <strong>News</strong> With yet more consolidation of software houses, Graeme Kidd painted a rather bleak outlook for innovative and original games. Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&rdquo; More tweaks were made to Crash&rsquo;s review process....

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Graeme Kidd lamented the glut of poor games with big movie, TV and arcade licenses attached. Were game developers spending too much time and money on the licenses while neglecting the actual games? And was this just a temporary phase or would it become a trend? Crash made some changes to their review system: reviews would now be signed, and the rated categories were massaged...

A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned...

The venue was the Camden Palace and plenty of gaming bigwigs were in attendance. Sadly the magazine failed to gain much traction, folding after only a handful of issues. The release of Amstrad&rsquo;s Spectrum +2 had many scratching their heads. Despite the official release having...

That number placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags. This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield,...

According to the rumours the machine would be Spectrum based but would use credit card sized &ldquo;cartridges&rdquo;. Reactions were mixed - while this would drastically reduce piracy, software houses feared Amstrad having control over what...
