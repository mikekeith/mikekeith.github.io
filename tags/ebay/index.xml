      <description>Well, this is rather fascinating: an Amiga 3000+ prototype board was sold on eBay by none other than Dave Haynie. It fetched a decent $2,155 USD and included a couple of his notebooks from the period when he was working on it.
As if the fact that such a board still exists isn&amp;rsquo;t interesting enough, he penned a long description of the board and what was going on at Commodore at the time.</description>
