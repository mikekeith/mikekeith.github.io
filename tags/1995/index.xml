The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid&#xA;was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought&#xA;out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Retailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a&#xA;new CD32 bundle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The specs included &amp;ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive,&#xA;32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&amp;rdquo;. And of course&#xA;it was The One&amp;rsquo;s April Fools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The only &amp;ldquo;big names&amp;rdquo;&#xA;attached to it were Christopher Lambert and Talisa Soto (a Bond girl in&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Licence to Kill&amp;rdquo;). Unknown Paul Anderson was to direct. Elsewhere there were&#xA;rumours of movies based on &amp;ldquo;Doom&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Myst&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The end did seem in sight (something that had&#xA;been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI&#xA;remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the&#xA;lack of new stock. With that said, apparently 82% of stores surveyed were keen&#xA;to continue selling the machines (if they were provided some to sell&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t without its price, tho: &amp;ldquo;So, it&amp;rsquo;s taken&#xA;us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and&#xA;getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fate of Commodore remained up in the air, with little news to be had. The&#xA;only new development of interest being that US-based Creative Equipment&#xA;International had put up a $1 million deposit as a first step towards an&#xA;acquisition. Commodore UK&amp;rsquo;s team remained the main other contender.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
