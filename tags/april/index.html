Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...

TV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during...

            This issue came hot on the heels of British Telecom&rsquo;s decision to bail out of the games industry. They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as...
