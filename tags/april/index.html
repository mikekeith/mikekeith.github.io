            <strong>News</strong> Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a reboot of Sinclair User&hellip; which made a little more sense. Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...

            <strong>News</strong> I&rsquo;m guessing this was an April Fools joke, but the lead news story concerned PC game &ldquo;X-Wing&rdquo; appearing &ldquo;on&rdquo; the Amiga&hellip; as in, it was a photo of an &ldquo;X-Wing&rdquo; box sitting on an Amiga&hellip; Mindscape revealed that their upcoming Gameboy platformer &ldquo;Alfred Chicken&rdquo; would be getting an Amiga release.

            <strong>News</strong> It seemed this would be the final issue for the whole editorial crew as they were being replaced by the folk from &ldquo;ex-sister magazine ACE&rdquo;. Such a drastic move must&rsquo;ve been a bitter pill to swallow, but it did mean the return of Gary Whitta. TV companies had begun to take an interest in video games, with Channel 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo; clocking in at around 3 million viewers during...

            This issue came hot on the heels of British Telecom&rsquo;s decision to bail out of the games industry. They were looking to sell off the Rainbird, Firebird and Silverbird labels as one lot, while winding Telecomsoft down. The official reason given was that games were no longer in line with the goals of BT, and the asking price was...

Ariolasoft’s Starlight label had three games on the way. &ldquo;Dogfight 2187&rdquo; promised 3D wireframe shoot ‘em up action with a vertically split screen giving two views of the action.

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &ldquo;coming of age&rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as...

Video rental customers would be &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; to donate while in video stores and there would be competitions and raffles. C&amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vixen&rdquo; was female &ldquo;doubly refreshing&rdquo;.
