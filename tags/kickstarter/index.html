Seeing &ldquo;Commando&rdquo; at my mate&rsquo;s place one afternoon after school helped convince me I needed a C64.

            !7dba80a9c63b579c3039fc566f4681cd_large.jpg 753 Colin Jones is probably best known for his excellent rock star management simulation, &ldquo;Rock Star Ate My Hamster&rdquo;, which featured many thinly veiled (rather biting) pop culture references. &ldquo;Slightly Magic&rdquo; was a later creation of his which was always intended to be part of a trilogy of games, but sadly the latter two chapters were never released. Colin is now hoping to resurrect Slightly, starting with an updated...

            !dragontorc_ad.jpg Andrew Hewson is running a Kickstarter for a new book detailing his experiences and insights from a long career in videogame development. I&rsquo;m not terribly keen on the title of the book (&ldquo;Hints &amp; Tips for Videogame Pioneers&rdquo;) as it sounds a bit like those &ldquo;Learn how to program C++ in 24 hours!&rdquo; books, but I would love to read his accounts of what was one my favourite software houses...

Well, Mel is now looking for backers to help fund the final stages of production. I&rsquo;m still unsure of just how the game will turn out (the original was more about the experience as a whole, rather than they gameplay itself), but it cannot be overstated how important the original and...
