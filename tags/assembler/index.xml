      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my last update work has been a bit quieter post-ship and I enjoyed an&#xA;unexpectedly low key Christmas break, so surely I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress,&#xA;right? Well&amp;hellip; life decided to intervene which resulted in a lot less time to&#xA;work on the game than I had hoped. But I have managed to tick off a few things&#xA;on the long to-do list&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ziggurat.co.nz/images/2019-02-24-2019224diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/image-asset.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;item-activation&#34;&gt;Item Activation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main - and, I must admit, only - playing facing addition is items that&#xA;need to be activated before they can be matched. Activation occurs when a&#xA;neighbour - regardless of colour - is matched and removed. I&amp;rsquo;ve reserved the&#xA;4th bit to indicate whether an item requires activation, which means I have 7&#xA;possible item types. So far I&amp;rsquo;m only using 4, so I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this will be&#xA;enough. However, I should be able to take the 5th bit to give 15 item types&#xA;(each with an unactivated variant) if need be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good grief, in my mind my last update was 3, maybe 4, months ago&amp;hellip; but May?!&#xA;Well, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve had &lt;a href=&#34;https://michael-keith-y85g.squarespace.com/news/2018/10/15/of-magic-leap-amp-dr-grordborts&#34;&gt;a decent excuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite being embarassingly tardy with writing updates, some progress has been&#xA;made. This is the current state of the game:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ziggurat.co.nz/images/2018-10-15-20181015diary-of-a-game-part-3-sprites-character-animation-and-input/20181015.2018-10-15-10_54_13.gif&#34; alt=&#34;20181015.2018-10-15 10_54_13.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sprites&#34;&gt;Sprites&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to stick with the C64&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Standard_Character_Mode&#34;&gt;standard character mode&lt;/a&gt; - I&#xA;may well switch to the multicolour character mode, but a character approach&#xA;seems to be working well. In order to draw the overlapping rows of items on&#xA;the board, I just change the horizontal scroll value every 8 lines which means&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t have to faff about with creating a bunch of extra in-between chars.&#xA;The downside to this is that as items/balls/whatever fall down, they jump left&#xA;and right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diary of a Game: Part 1 - Wha&#39; Happen?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this&#xA;series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I&#xA;knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but&#xA;what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another,&#xA;longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a&#xA;single weekend. Work-wise it was a very productive and beneficial time, but it&#xA;did mean that other things slipped through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Wait,&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t walk away! It&amp;rsquo;ll get better, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various&#xA;points I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my&#xA;spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made&#xA;it through to the end and even that took way too long. The reasons for the&#xA;slow/non-existent progress have typically revolved around being swamped with&#xA;work, being overly ambitious and getting distracted by new shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
