Mandarin Software were developing &ldquo;Grand Prix Circuit&rdquo;, an F1 racing sim to be published by Accolade. Elite&rsquo;s lineup for Christmas included &ldquo;Space Harrier 2&rdquo; for the 16bits (seems that Grandslam actually had the rights for that, weird) , &ldquo;Mike Read’s Pop Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Storm Warrior&rdquo;....

            <strong>News</strong> The big buzz this month was the arrival of &ldquo;Xenon&rdquo; for the Amiga and ST which heralded the first true coin-op quality game on home computers. Electronic Arts were working on a graphic adventure for the Amiga called &ldquo;Return to Atlantis&rdquo;. Infocom were trying something a bit different with their Infocomix line of interactive comics. Rather than a typical adventure game, each issue would allow the reader to...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw Eugene Lacey take over as editor. Lacey came from editing Commodore User, and had been a C&amp;VG staff writer sometime earlier. Go!&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; promised arcade action featuring up to 18 aliens at any one time. Sega&rsquo;s Master System recently launched in the UK and now a slew of titles were heading its way. These included: &ldquo;Kung-Kid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fantasy Zone II&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Burner&rdquo;, &ldquo;Global Defense&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zaxxon 3D&rdquo;,...

C&amp;VG assured readers it was &ldquo;simply brilliant&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> Perhaps the biggest news for Zzap! readers this month was that Julian Rignall had left Newsfield to take up freelancing (including for rival publisher EMAP). Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start). Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;, &ldquo;World Darts&rdquo; (may have become &ldquo;180&rdquo;), &ldquo;Night Racer&rdquo; and a...

Up until this point Microprose&rsquo;s games had been distributed in the UK by US Gold, but now they were going to handle it all themselves. This would allow them to use much fancier packaging, for starters. Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations.
