            One of these days I’ll get my act together and not wait until the dying hours of the month (and even year in this case) to write these things… With that said, I did manage to have a decent play on a bunch of the biggest December games from 1986 and 1988. * * * !”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986 3116 ”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986 Reviewed Zzap!64 December 1986....

            <strong>News</strong> There were big changes at the mag, with Tony Takoushi &ldquo;getting the boot&rdquo; and replaced by Julian Rignall. This issue hit 114 pages. Mandarin Software were developing &ldquo;Grand Prix Circuit&rdquo;, an F1 racing sim to be published by Accolade. Elite&rsquo;s lineup for Christmas included &ldquo;Space Harrier 2&rdquo; for the 16bits (seems that Grandslam actually had the rights for that, weird) , &ldquo;Mike Read’s Pop Quiz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Storm Warrior&rdquo;....

            I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare.

Early indications were that Batman had the edge. Loricel&rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche racing game &ldquo;944 Turbo Cup&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> May 28th would see Video Charity Day take place as part of the &ldquo;massive&rdquo; &lsquo;88 Telethon charity drive. Video rental customers would be &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; to donate while in video stores and there would be competitions and raffles. C&amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vixen&rdquo; was female &ldquo;doubly refreshing&rdquo;. The double part may have been a reference to the game&rsquo;s cover/advertisements which featured a photo...

            <strong>News</strong> The big buzz this month was the arrival of &ldquo;Xenon&rdquo; for the Amiga and ST which heralded the first true coin-op quality game on home computers. Electronic Arts were working on a graphic adventure for the Amiga called &ldquo;Return to Atlantis&rdquo;. Infocom were trying something a bit different with their Infocomix line of interactive comics. Rather than a typical adventure game, each issue would allow the reader to...

            <strong>News</strong> This month saw Eugene Lacey take over as editor. Lacey came from editing Commodore User, and had been a C&amp;VG staff writer sometime earlier. Go!&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; promised arcade action featuring up to 18 aliens at any one time. Sega&rsquo;s Master System recently launched in the UK and now a slew of titles were heading its way. These included: &ldquo;Kung-Kid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fantasy Zone II&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Burner&rdquo;, &ldquo;Global Defense&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zaxxon 3D&rdquo;,...

C&amp;VG assured readers it was &ldquo;simply brilliant&rdquo;.

            <strong>News</strong> Perhaps the biggest news for Zzap! readers this month was that Julian Rignall had left Newsfield to take up freelancing (including for rival publisher EMAP). Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start). Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &ldquo;Rogue&rdquo;, &ldquo;World Darts&rdquo; (may have become &ldquo;180&rdquo;), &ldquo;Night Racer&rdquo; and a...

Up until this point Microprose&rsquo;s games had been distributed in the UK by US Gold, but now they were going to handle it all themselves. This would allow them to use much fancier packaging, for starters. Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations.

            <strong>News</strong> After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The reception was luke warm at best: &ldquo;is Amstrad&rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business computer or a games machine that&rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&rdquo; Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date was to be January 28th and would include a bunch...

            <strong>News</strong> Word on the street was that Atari was readying not one, but <em>four</em> new ST machines. The main one would be a &ldquo;super ST&rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a &ldquo;Pocket PC&rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many...

            <strong>News</strong> Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST. A small...

            <strong>News</strong> Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&rsquo;s price in line with the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games.
