      <description>Postal strikes had caused delays to the first issue, and - whether it was due to this or some other reason - November came and went without the second issue. Going forward they would be sticking to the every-other-month schedule.

      <description>One of these days I’ll get my act together and not wait until the dying hours of the month (and even year in this case) to write these things… With that said, I did manage to have a decent play on a bunch of the biggest December games from 1986 and 1988.
”The Sentinel”, Geoff Crammond/Firebird, 1986
Reviewed Zzap!64 December 1986.
I recall playing this quite a bit on the C64.</description>

      <description>News There were big changes at the mag, with Tony Takoushi &amp;ldquo;getting the boot&amp;rdquo; and replaced by Julian Rignall. This issue hit 114 pages.
Mandarin Software were developing &amp;ldquo;Grand Prix Circuit&amp;rdquo;, an F1 racing sim to be published by Accolade.
Elite&amp;rsquo;s lineup for Christmas included &amp;ldquo;Space Harrier 2&amp;rdquo; for the 16bits (seems that Grandslam actually had the rights for that, weird) , &amp;ldquo;Mike Read’s Pop Quiz&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Storm Warrior&amp;rdquo;. Their arcade truck racer &amp;ldquo;Supertrux&amp;rdquo; was narrowly going to miss the holiday season and was due early January.</description>

      <description>I had hoped to have a number of opportunities to spend some quality time playing these games (and more) this month, but one of the downsides of travelling so much for business is that such occasions are rare. Very rare in the case of this month: I managed a pathetic few hours last Sunday.
At any rate&amp;hellip; Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief look back at a few games that hit the shelves in November many years ago to rave reviews.</description>

      <description>News It was Superman vs Batman as to who would have the better game. Tynesoft delivering the former, while Ocean took on the latter. Early indications were that Batman had the edge.
Loricel&amp;rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche racing game &amp;ldquo;944 Turbo Cup&amp;rdquo;. Driver Rene Metge (&amp;ldquo;who?&amp;rdquo; asked C&amp;amp;VG) provided the endorsement and the software house hoped to include a model car in the box, but apparently British retailers weren&amp;rsquo;t so keen.</description>

C&amp;amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Vixen&amp;rdquo; was female &amp;ldquo;doubly refreshing&amp;rdquo;. The double part may have been a reference to the game&amp;rsquo;s cover/advertisements which featured a photo of a Page 3 girl Corinne Russell.</description>

Electronic Arts were working on a graphic adventure for the Amiga called &amp;ldquo;Return to Atlantis&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>News This month saw Eugene Lacey take over as editor. Lacey came from editing Commodore User, and had been a C&amp;amp;VG staff writer sometime earlier.
Go!&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Bedlam&amp;rdquo; promised arcade action featuring up to 18 aliens at any one time.

      <description>News Perhaps the biggest news for Zzap! readers this month was that Julian Rignall had left Newsfield to take up freelancing (including for rival publisher EMAP). Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start).
Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &amp;ldquo;Rogue&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;World Darts&amp;rdquo; (may have become &amp;ldquo;180&amp;rdquo;), &amp;ldquo;Night Racer&amp;rdquo; and a re-release of Activision&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Transformers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Mastertronic was to release a followup to &amp;ldquo;Kane&amp;rdquo;, unsurprisingly called &amp;ldquo;Kane II&amp;rdquo;.
Up until this point Microprose&amp;rsquo;s games had been distributed in the UK by US Gold, but now they were going to handle it all themselves. This would allow them to use much fancier packaging, for starters.
Tynesoft and Virgin were both readying new compilations.
Elite started a new budget label, Encore, which would see their back catalogue classics re-released.</description>

Domark were producing &amp;ldquo;Live and Let Die&amp;rdquo;, a game based on Roger Moore&amp;rsquo;s first Bond film.

      <description>I managed to miss May by one day - mea culpa.
News Julian Rignall defended the status of the C64 in light of the recently arrived 16bit machines, citing the strength of recent release compared to rather disappointing 16bit titles: &amp;ldquo;To me, the Commodore 64 is leading the way when it comes to new ideas - Driller, the up-and-coming Echelon, Apollo 18, Nebulus, Soko Ban and Deflektor are recent examples that inject new life and innovation into the computer game format.</description>

      <description>News Gordon Leslie Houghton was the newest person to join the Zzap!64 writing team.
Hard to know whether Zzap! fell for an April fools, or were behind it themselves, but they carried a news story about a Norwegian firm creating a C64 add-on that would turn the humble 64 into an Amiga. The &amp;ldquo;Amulator&amp;rdquo; was being made by Blue Tec and would cost around £280.
Features Martin Walker had just finished off &amp;ldquo;Hunter&amp;rsquo;s Moon&amp;rdquo; and had embarked on a new dev diary for his next (yet to be decided) game.</description>

      <description>News Rather oddly there was no news section, despite it being a bumper issue. Perhaps this was a change of direction now that Julian Rignall was editor?
Features Jon Hare provided a run down of how to use SEUCK.

      <description>News The console wars were heating up as rumours surfaced that Nintendo and Sega were working on 16bit machines. Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly enthusiastic about the Konix Slipstream: &amp;ldquo;I think Konix has the potential to be another Amstrad.</description>

      <description>News After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The reception was luke warm at best: &amp;ldquo;is Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business computer or a games machine that&amp;rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&amp;rdquo;
Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date was to be January 28th and would include a bunch of add ons, including the hydraulic chair.</description>

      <description>News Word on the street was that Atari was readying not one, but four new ST machines. The main one would be a &amp;ldquo;super ST&amp;rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a &amp;ldquo;Pocket PC&amp;rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many of these would actually hit the selves?</description>

      <description>News Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST.
A small South Wales company called Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) was about to release a Spectrum &amp;ldquo;super clone&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&amp;rsquo;s price in line with the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&amp;rsquo;s destiny would be games.
Sugar&amp;rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s Sky satellite TV company which would see Amstrad producing and selling £199 dishes that would receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following year.</description>

      <description>News Not a game as such, but the latest book from William Gibson, &amp;ldquo;Mona Lisa Overdrive&amp;rdquo;, was about to hit the shelves. To mark the occasion, the Cyberpunk theme would be visited several times in this issue.

      <description>News &amp;ldquo;Computers and Art&amp;rdquo; was a new travelling exhibition that had just opened at the IBM Gallery of Science and Art in NYC. It was an attempt to bring &amp;ldquo;computer art&amp;rdquo; into the mainstream - not just graphics, but works using fabric etc. Elsewhere, Carnegie Mellon began a course on writing &amp;ldquo;interactive fiction.&amp;rdquo; CRL&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Wolfman&amp;rdquo; was in the news for failing to be slapped with a British Board of Censors rating certificate, unlike their previous adventures.</description>

      <description>News Rare had been inundated with calls from developers wanting in on the Nintendo market and the Z80 arcade board that they (Rare) were working on. This all follows on from a pretty amazing interview with Rare in the previous issue of TGM - amazing because it was the first (and perhaps only?) proper interview conducted with the Stamper brothers. Everyone had been wondering what happened to Ultimate Play The Game (arguably the finest developer of the 8bit years), and now we all knew.</description>
