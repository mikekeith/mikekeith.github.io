      <description>When I made the decision to join Magic Leap back at the start of 2013, I told my friends that I had no idea where it was going to lead, but I knew it would be a ride&amp;hellip; and that it was.
It&amp;rsquo;s two weeks to the day that myself, my team here in NZ and over 1,000 of my workmates at offices across the world were laid off. Well, technically those of us in NZ entered into a &amp;ldquo;consultation&amp;rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant.</description>
