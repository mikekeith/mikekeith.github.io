      <description>News Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &amp;ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.&#xA;Retailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a new CD32 bundle.</description>

      <description>News The One had had a bit of a facelift with the Contents page getting a re- design, along with various sections getting re-labelled.&#xA;The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &amp;ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&amp;rdquo;. And of course it was The One&amp;rsquo;s April Fools.</description>

      <description>News Despite some recent colossal flops at the box office (&amp;ldquo;Mario Brothers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Double Dragon&amp;rdquo;) it seemed the success of &amp;ldquo;Street Fighter&amp;rdquo; was enough for Hollywood to take another stab it with &amp;ldquo;Mortal Kombat&amp;rdquo;. The only &amp;ldquo;big names&amp;rdquo; attached to it were Christopher Lambert and Talisa Soto (a Bond girl in &amp;ldquo;Licence to Kill&amp;rdquo;). Unknown Paul Anderson was to direct. Elsewhere there were rumours of movies based on &amp;ldquo;Doom&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Myst&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role.&#xA;If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said, apparently 82% of stores surveyed were keen to continue selling the machines (if they were provided some to sell&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>News Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm, delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t without its price, tho: &amp;ldquo;So, it&amp;rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The fate of Commodore remained up in the air, with little news to be had.</description>

      <description>News While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a “buying show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left to purchase by then.</description>

      <description>News Editor Simon Byron announced he was stepping down to work at a chip shop on the outskirts of Bognor: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that the life of a simple chippy is preferable to slogging my guts out on Britain&amp;rsquo;s least popular Amiga games magazine.&amp;rdquo; Andy Nuttall would be filling in as Acting Editor.&#xA;Frustrating times for Amiga journos and fans alike as there was still no news from Commodore on the future of the company.</description>

      <description>News After reporting that the saga of Commodore&amp;rsquo;s fate would be resolved &amp;ldquo;any day now&amp;rdquo; for the past few months, The One decided to quit guessing the timeline. In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen. At the US head office Mehdi Ali was officially out.</description>

      <description>theone199408&#xA;News While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a foothold in the European market. It seemed everything was hanging on that deal.&#xA;Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &amp;ldquo;Gamesmaster&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value in 1993 was £670 million compared to £700 million in 1992.</description>

      <description>News The fate of Commodore UK was close to becoming a bit clearer with an announcement regarding a new owner was due &amp;ldquo;any day now&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;most solid&amp;rdquo; information pointed to a &amp;ldquo;Far-Eastern&amp;rdquo; company, with Acer, Samsung and Goldstar all rumoured to be in the running. While the UK office had continued trading, they weren&amp;rsquo;t receiving any new units to sell which meant they had to make do with whatever stock they had in their warehouses.</description>

      <description>News News broke as the mag went to press that Commodore worldwide had basically filed for administration in the Bahamas, where the company was registered. Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move was obviously concerning, The One were confident that the continued popularity of the Amiga would mean a positive outcome one way or another.</description>

      <description>News Andy Nuttall (aka “Nutts”) joined the mag as Deputy Editor after having done five months hard time at ST Format.&#xA;Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle since launch. The Voyage pack included “Microcosm” and “The Chaos Engine”, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks lasted, all for £299.99.&#xA;Codemasters were bringing “Captain Dynamo” and the “Dizzy CD Collection” to the CD32.</description>

      <description>News Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a reboot of Sinclair User&amp;hellip; which made a little more sense.&#xA;Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind Snooker”, “Archer Maclean’s Pool”, “Realms”, “Legend of Kyrandia”, “Supremacy”, “KGB”, “Reach for the Skies”, “Shuttle” and “Lure of the Temptress”.</description>

      <description>theone199403&#xA;News This was to be David Upchurch&amp;rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&amp;rsquo;s relaunch of&amp;hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm.&#xA;Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &amp;ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&amp;rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&amp;rsquo;em up featuring new AGA backdrops, digitised speech and a digital CD soundtrack.</description>

      <description>News Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga.&#xA;Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &amp;ldquo;Rebel Assault&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&amp;rdquo; to the CD32. (It didn&amp;rsquo;t happen)&#xA;While England had suffered the shame of failing to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, Virgin were keen to join with Adidas to sponsor a new initiative to promote youth footballing skills.</description>

      <description>News Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting &amp;ldquo;Sim City 2000&amp;rdquo; to the Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation?&#xA;It looked like &amp;ldquo;The Second Samurai&amp;rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&amp;rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration work be finished before a single line of code was written.</description>

      <description>News Editor David Upchurch had “deserted” the mag for a couple of months which left Simon Byron in charge.&#xA;The CD32 received some encouraging news as high street retailer Menzies announced they would be stocking it in time for Christmas.&#xA;After some months of silence (on the Amiga at any rate), Thalamus was about to release “S.U.B.” (unreleased). The One wondered what had happened to “Arsenal” - rumour was the programmer had gone missing&amp;hellip; It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see the light of day.</description>

      <description>News The CD32 launch hadn&amp;rsquo;t exactly gotten off to a great start, with sales looking rather lacklustre. To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &amp;lsquo;93 exhibition and an upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &amp;lsquo;93 was such a big hit that Commodore had already booked its presence at next year&amp;rsquo;s event.</description>

      <description>News Renegade&amp;rsquo;s release schedule was looking rather impressive with “Uridium 2” first up, followed soon after by “Turrican 3” and “Elfmania”. If that wasn’t enough, “Ruff ‘n’ Tumble”, “Sensible World of Soccer”, “Flight of the Amazon Queen” and “Z”) were all due by the end of the year. The last one - a real time strategy game from the Bitmap Brothers - was particularly interesting since it’d be years before it saw the light of day.</description>

      <description>News In an effort to draw some attention away from the other popular gaming mascots, Mindscape decided to enter &amp;ldquo;Alfred the Chicken&amp;rdquo; in the Christchurch by-election. Alfred managed to bring in 18 votes - two ahead of the Rainbow Alliance Party. The resulting media &amp;ldquo;circus&amp;rdquo; was certainly worth the 500 quid it cost them.&#xA;Europress teased some screen shots of racing sim &amp;ldquo;Rally&amp;rdquo;, though they were from the PC version.</description>

      <description>News A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that Sierra On-Line were bringing &amp;ldquo;King&amp;rsquo;s Quest VI&amp;rdquo; to our beloved machine. The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&amp;rsquo;s Revolution which had created a hybrid of its &amp;ldquo;Virtual Theatre&amp;rdquo; system for the job to ensure the game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port.&#xA;Krisalis spawned a new sub-label, Buzz, as home for its back catalogue.</description>

      <description>News I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this was an April Fools joke, but the lead news story concerned PC game &amp;ldquo;X-Wing&amp;rdquo; appearing &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; the Amiga&amp;hellip; as in, it was a photo of an &amp;ldquo;X-Wing&amp;rdquo; box sitting on an Amiga&amp;hellip;&#xA;Mindscape revealed that their upcoming Gameboy platformer &amp;ldquo;Alfred Chicken&amp;rdquo; would be getting an Amiga release.&#xA;Ocean reckoned that the somewhat crowded car racer genre was in need of something with a bit more realism.</description>

The mag decided to lend him an Amiga and a copy of &amp;ldquo;Deluxe Paint&amp;rdquo; for a followup article, which sparked his interest in computer art and lead to an introduction to Cecil.</description>

      <description>News Under the headline &amp;ldquo;Kick Off 3 Shocker!&amp;rdquo; came the news that Dino Dini had parted ways with Anco and signed with Virgin to develop a &amp;ldquo;world-beating follow-up to &amp;lsquo;Kick Off 2&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;, with the working title &amp;ldquo;Goal!&amp;rdquo;. The move cast doubts on whether there would be an official &amp;ldquo;Kick Off 3&amp;rdquo;, though co-designer Steve Screech remained at Anco.&#xA;From the ashes of the hyped &amp;ldquo;Apocalypse&amp;rdquo;, Jason Perkins and Robin Levy were continuing their partnership on a new game from Renegade, &amp;ldquo;Ruff n&amp;rsquo; Tumble&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Digital Image Design had two new titles on the way. The first up was a &amp;ldquo;pseudo-sequel&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Epic&amp;rdquo; - called &amp;ldquo;Odyssey&amp;rdquo; - set 90 years further in the future and would feature more of an open world feel. Sadly it looks like it was never released.. The second was another sequel, jet fighter sim &amp;ldquo;TFX Inferno&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Relative newcomer Miracle Games were rather bullish about their upcoming platformer, &amp;ldquo;Miracle Bat&amp;rdquo;.</description>

This took a slightly different twist on the original, with the goal being to re-unite twelve tribes of Lemmings, each tribe having a different theme complete with their own abilities.&#xA;An update to Sensi Software&amp;rsquo;s smash hit &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo; had arrived and boasted a bevy of new and improved features, including red &amp;amp; yellow cards, the back pass rule and more competent goalies.</description>

      <description>News Ocean had scored a #1 hit last Christmas with ”WWF Wrestlemania”, and hoped for a repeat in the form of ”WWF European Rampage”. While the earlier title had been panned by critics, the publisher were adamant this one would be better.&#xA;Commodore had announced the A4000 which, with a £1999 price tag, was very much targeted at the serious user. This fuelled rumours of a more affordable gaming machine and right as the mag went to press it looked like they had news&amp;hellip; though that would have to wait until next month.</description>

      <description>News After months of mystery, Dino Dini&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Kick Off 3&amp;rdquo; was finally unveiled. Unlike the second instalment which was effectively tweaks and improvements to the original&amp;rsquo;s codebase, this one was re-coded from the ground up. Would it be able to take back the crown from &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer&amp;rdquo; ?&#xA;Speaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn&amp;rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and &amp;ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1&amp;rdquo; was due out next month. Player and club data had been updated for the new season, and there were other welcome changes such as re-written goalie behaviour.</description>

It would be a 32bit machine with 68030 CPU and would sit between the A600 and the A1500. Commodore&amp;rsquo;s Market Director Kelly Sumner was adamant there would be no machine called the A800, but did confirm there was another machine on the way&amp;hellip; I assume it was the A1200.</description>

      <description>News Sad news this month as one of the oldest software houses closed up shop. Palace Software had been going for almost a decade and had been behind some cracking games, including &amp;ldquo;Barbarian&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sacred Armour of Antiriad&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Shoot&amp;rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&amp;rdquo;. The move came after months of legal wrangling, and the London office became Titus&amp;rsquo;s UK HQ. It was unclear what would happen with titles like &amp;ldquo;Hostile Breed&amp;rdquo; (unreleased, but was actually finished and reviewed two issues earlier), and &amp;ldquo;Super Barbarian&amp;rdquo; (also unreleased).</description>

      <description>News The transformation/infiltration/coup was complete and the team from ACE magazine had taken over reigns. The One for Amiga was now just &amp;ldquo;The One&amp;rdquo; as the ST mag had been rolled into ST Action. Notable changes included the scrapping of the developer profile section (which I personally liked) in favour of &amp;ldquo;special interviews&amp;rdquo; because the latter was &amp;ldquo;simply more interesting&amp;rdquo;, and more detailed, critical reviews (the previous team may have gone a little easy on games).</description>

      <description>News Hot off the presses from Japan was news of the PC Engine Super Grafx which looked to build on the already impressive original. New custom chips meant it could chuck around 128 sprites (up from 64) and the cartridges saw a decent boost in size. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect was the Power Console add on which the console slotted into and featured a full on steering yoke, a gear stick/throttle, LCD clock/timer, LED radar display, numeric keypad and a bunch of buttons and knobs.</description>

While that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem terribly exciting, it did have one interesting feature: the ability to run most Speccy games. The SAM Coupe was due to launch in the UK on November 20th.&#xA;With Christmas around the corner, Hewson were to release a couple of compilations.</description>

On paper the specs weren&amp;rsquo;t up to much when compared to Nintendo and Sega&amp;rsquo;s offerings, but at £69.95 it looked decent value for money.

      <description>News This month saw C&amp;amp;VG getting a revamp based on reader feedback. Coin ops and consoles would get more pages, the adventure section got a make over, there was more space dedicated to previews and overall there would be a lot more colour. The announcement of these changes referenced the fact that some features were dropped, but they didn’t actually specify which. Somewhat worryingly, there were no adventure game reviews - just some tips.</description>

Cheeky.&#xA;The reason for such a cover? Sales had climbed to 67,728 per month and showed no signs of letting up. The mag would be undergoing a few changes - they looked to be broadening the scope of what they were covering, including “unusual, but relevant” features.</description>

      <description>[Oh dear, I got confused and thought this was the April issue.. turns out my April issue appears to be missing - no doubt the fault of one of my High School friends back in the day]&#xA;News Rignall and Glancey took on Domark’s Mark Strachan and Andy Blazdell in three rounds of Tengen’s &amp;ldquo;Vindicators&amp;rdquo; arcade machine. The C&amp;amp;VG lads won two out of three and claimed the Tengen Trophy.</description>

      <description>News A couple of new arrivals at Zzap! this month, with Steve Jarratt swapping industrial chemistry for games journalism and Philipa Irving who, er, swapped Crash for its Newsfield sibling.&#xA;Ariolasoft’s Starlight label had three games on the way. &amp;ldquo;Dogfight 2187&amp;rdquo; promised 3D wireframe shoot ‘em up action with a vertically split screen giving two views of the action. The other two games were &amp;ldquo;Deathscape&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Greyfell”. Meanwhile Tony Crowther had teamed up with Keith Blake and Ross Goodley to develop ”Challenge of the Gobots” based on the popular kids cartoon, which would be published by Ariolasoft.</description>

      <description>News Gary Penn wrote a long editorial on a matter that had been on a lot of people’s minds: had quality and innovation taken a dive as software houses relied more and more on coin-op, TV and film licenses? The market seemed to be full of these unimaginative and often shoddy tie ins which, aside from the attached IP, only had good presentation going for them. Developers were feeling the pinch as well: publishers would “guarantee 100,000” copies sold, giving them an excuse to lower royalties.</description>

      <description>News Michael Jackson’s “Moonwalker” movie had only just come out and US Gold had already snaffled the game license.&#xA;Titus announced their futuristic deadly sport game &amp;ldquo;Titan”.&#xA;The Vocalizer 1000 was a music gadget where the user would hum/whistle/sing a tune at it and it would detect the varying pitches and allow playback of the tune using a selection of 28 instruments.&#xA;Gary Liddon was teaming up with renowned game artist Paul Docherty to develop &amp;ldquo;Tyger Tyger&amp;rdquo; for Mastertronic’s Ricochet label.</description>

      <description>News Gary Penn responded to grumblings from readers about the Christmas issue. The main complaints were around the lack of reviews and the price. The former issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers.&#xA;Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64. They included: &amp;ldquo;Tempest” (unreleased?</description>

      <description>News &amp;ldquo;Death Stalks the Night&amp;rdquo; was an upcoming arcade adventure from Ubi Soft where the player assumed the role as Count Dracula to take on “the usual Van Helsings”.&#xA;New software house EAS announced a space trading game called &amp;ldquo;STAG&amp;rdquo; for the Amiga and ST.&#xA;Mr Chip’s &amp;ldquo;Wrangler&amp;rdquo;would see the player take control over Clint Eastwood (yes, apparently) and his ‘droid in what looked like a puzzle game.&#xA;Budget label Alternative were moving into the 16bits with Don Priestly’s &amp;ldquo;Mad Flunky”, a follow-up to his Spectrum game &amp;ldquo;Flunky”.</description>

      <description>News In his editorial, Gary Penn lamented the fact that for the first time there had not been a single Sizzler or Gold Medal awarded in an issue. Well, that’s not entirely true as &amp;ldquo;The Bard’s Tale&amp;rdquo; picked up a very respectable Sizzler, though apparently it didn’t count as it was “a role playing game”. It seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before Christmas to polish up their hopeful hits.</description>

      <description>News C&amp;amp;VG were giving away a Body Rap toy which would be strapped to your body and emit audio (bass, drum, snare, cymbal etc) when hit. They described it as a “neat little gizmo” but I can’t imagine it being anything other than dreadful.&#xA;The Amiga, ST and Amstrad versions of Titus’ car racing game &amp;ldquo;Crazy Cars II&amp;rdquo; were on the shelves, with the C64 due this month.&#xA;German software house Rainbow Arts were to release &amp;ldquo;Spherical”, a Gauntlet-style game, and &amp;ldquo;The Game&amp;rdquo; which promised to be a “space battle spectacular.</description>

      <description>News More changes were afoot, with Strategy Front writer Sean Masterson moving on and the start of a make over that would take effect during the next few months.&#xA;Last month Zzap! teased readers by asking them to check out a screenshot of the hotly anticipated arcade conversion of &amp;ldquo;Gauntlet&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; and then failed to print it. To make up for the error they provided not one but four shots.</description>

This issue hit 114 pages.&#xA;Mandarin Software were developing &amp;ldquo;Grand Prix Circuit&amp;rdquo;, an F1 racing sim to be published by Accolade.&#xA;Elite&amp;rsquo;s lineup for Christmas included &amp;ldquo;Space Harrier 2&amp;rdquo; for the 16bits (seems that Grandslam actually had the rights for that, weird) , &amp;ldquo;Mike Read’s Pop Quiz&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Storm Warrior&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>News Editor Gary Penn trumpeted the success of Zzap!, saying that it had become the &amp;ldquo;biggest selling Commodore magazine in the civilised World.&amp;rdquo; The healthy sales meant more advertisers, which meant more content - this month the mag hit 148 pages.&#xA;A Commodore show took place in Manchester. Commodore did have a stand (which apparently bore a resemblance to Parisian public toilets), where they were showing off was the Amiga.</description>

      <description>News It was Superman vs Batman as to who would have the better game. Tynesoft delivering the former, while Ocean took on the latter. Early indications were that Batman had the edge.&#xA;Loricel&amp;rsquo;s next attempt to crack the UK would come in the form of Porsche racing game &amp;ldquo;944 Turbo Cup&amp;rdquo;. Driver Rene Metge (&amp;ldquo;who?&amp;rdquo; asked C&amp;amp;VG) provided the endorsement and the software house hoped to include a model car in the box, but apparently British retailers weren&amp;rsquo;t so keen.</description>

It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs. No-one forces them to publish contagious rubbish but magazines that do so are not simply to be described as boring, but debasing the values of their readership&amp;hellip; and polluting the social and commercial environment in which we live and work.</description>

      <description>News In his editorial, Roger Kean pondered whether the games industry &amp;ldquo;coming of age&amp;rdquo; after 5-ish years with the conglomeration of software houses and the emergence of a small number of dominating companies was a good thing. On the one hand it did mean developers were able to focus more on creating games rather than managing the marketing and distribution, but on the other the desire to get as many games on the shelves as possible was putting a real strain on quality.</description>

      <description>News May 28th would see Video Charity Day take place as part of the &amp;ldquo;massive&amp;rdquo; &amp;lsquo;88 Telethon charity drive. Video rental customers would be &amp;ldquo;encouraged&amp;rdquo; to donate while in video stores and there would be competitions and raffles.&#xA;C&amp;amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Vixen&amp;rdquo; was female &amp;ldquo;doubly refreshing&amp;rdquo;. The double part may have been a reference to the game&amp;rsquo;s cover/advertisements which featured a photo of a Page 3 girl Corinne Russell.</description>

      <description>News Commodore announced they were closing their Corby factory and ceasing the manufacture of the 64 in Britain. Was this a sign of bigger troubles? The price of the C64 remained higher than that of competitors, and rather than address this, Commodore had introduced the C16 - but what did this actually solve?&#xA;English Software were finally about to release &amp;ldquo;Elektra Glide&amp;rdquo; on the C64 - some months after the original Atari version.</description>

      <description>News The big buzz this month was the arrival of &amp;ldquo;Xenon&amp;rdquo; for the Amiga and ST which heralded the first true coin-op quality game on home computers.&#xA;Electronic Arts were working on a graphic adventure for the Amiga called &amp;ldquo;Return to Atlantis&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Infocom were trying something a bit different with their Infocomix line of interactive comics. Rather than a typical adventure game, each issue would allow the reader to choose their path through the storyline.</description>

      <description>News This month&amp;rsquo;s editorial warned readers to expect some divisive reviews. Not divisive in that reviewers were unable to agree, but in the sense that they had some truly great games, some utterly awful, and few in between. So some &amp;ldquo;savage criticism&amp;rdquo; was in store.&#xA;One amusing aspect of the editorial is that Roger Kean seemed quite bothered by the fact that a reader had written in to complain about Kean&amp;rsquo;s assertion that the C64&amp;rsquo;s xmas release schedule was &amp;ldquo;disappointing&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Gordon Houghton took over as editor, and there were quite a few changes (mainly cosmetic, but also an expanded news section for a start).&#xA;Mastertronic had a bunch of upcoming releases planned: &amp;ldquo;Rogue&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;World Darts&amp;rdquo; (may have become &amp;ldquo;180&amp;rdquo;), &amp;ldquo;Night Racer&amp;rdquo; and a re-release of Activision&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Transformers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

The cover of the game came with a &amp;ldquo;Not suitable for persons under the age of 16&amp;rdquo; label.&#xA;Paul Hardcastle had a big hit with his Vietnam war song &amp;ldquo;19&amp;rdquo; and Cascade were turning it into a game.

      <description>News With yet more consolidation of software houses, Graeme Kidd painted a rather bleak outlook for innovative and original games. Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &amp;ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;More tweaks were made to Crash&amp;rsquo;s review process. The quality of software had improved substantially since the early days and it was time for Crash to take a step back and judge games on a scale where 50% meant an average game.</description>

Ultimate said that they were going to concentrate on making games and planned to release six new titles during 1986. What wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear was just how involved the Stamper brothers were to be, but it would turn out that they already had their eyes on the new Japanese consoles and the formation of a certain company called Rare.</description>

And was this just a temporary phase or would it become a trend?&#xA;Crash made some changes to their review system: reviews would now be signed, and the rated categories were massaged (Getting Started and Use Of Computer were replaced by Presentation).</description>

      <description>News Andrew Braybrook revealed his new game, &amp;ldquo;Uridium&amp;rdquo;. It promised &amp;ldquo;super- fast scrolling and authentically addictive action&amp;rdquo; and would certainly end up delivering.&#xA;Infocom slashed the prices on several of their games for a Christmas promotion. &amp;ldquo;Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide To The Galaxy&amp;rdquo; would drop to £24.95, while others would be between £14 and £22.&#xA;Two schoolboys raised £80 for famine relief in Ethiopia by playing games for 24 hours. The games included &amp;ldquo;Castle Quest&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Alien 8&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Revs&amp;rdquo;, all on their BBC which apparently &amp;ldquo;did get a bit hot.</description>

      <description>News This month saw a new &amp;ldquo;bigger and brighter&amp;rdquo; look for TGM.&#xA;Excitement was growing for the impending release of the Konix Slipstream megaconsole. Costing a mere £149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would be able to read software from standard 3&amp;quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce - customers could look forward to paying only 15 quid for games.</description>

      <description>News With the news that Ultimate had morphed into Rare and committed exclusively to consoles - due to hit the UK in the coming months - and the arrival of powerful 16bit machines, Graeme Kidd tried allay the fears of readers about the future of the Speccy. A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned all those talented programmers weren&amp;rsquo;t going to suddenly jump ship to the new platforms.</description>

      <description>News The console wars were heating up as rumours surfaced that Nintendo and Sega were working on 16bit machines. Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly enthusiastic about the Konix Slipstream: &amp;ldquo;I think Konix has the potential to be another Amstrad.</description>

While the event was usually held in the &amp;ldquo;cavernous&amp;rdquo; Royal Horticultural Hall, a booking mixup meant this one had to move to &amp;ldquo;several rooms and various floors&amp;rdquo; at Central Hall in Westminster.

The venue was the Camden Palace and plenty of gaming bigwigs were in attendance. Sadly the magazine failed to gain much traction, folding after only a handful of issues.&#xA;The release of Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Spectrum +2 had many scratching their heads.

      <description>News After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The reception was luke warm at best: &amp;ldquo;is Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business computer or a games machine that&amp;rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date was to be January 28th and would include a bunch of add ons, including the hydraulic chair.</description>

The main one would be a &amp;ldquo;super ST&amp;rdquo; that would take on the Amiga, then there was a portable ST, a &amp;ldquo;Pocket PC&amp;rdquo; and an ST based console. Not only that, but the existing 520STFM would have its price slashed by £100 and get a software bundle valued at £440. How many of these would actually hit the selves?</description>

That number placed Crash ahead of all other computer mags.&#xA;This issue was the first to feature a cover drawn by someone other than Oliver Frey - Ian Craig was the illustrator responsible. It seemed that with the increasing array of magazines published by Newsfield, Frey had too much on his plate.</description>

      <description>News Atari appeared to be winning the battle of the 16bits. A combination of a very generous software bundle, price drop and big ad campaign saw sales of the ST see a rise even during the usual summer slump. Meanwhile, the Amiga was still having problems with reliability - some shops putting returns as high as 25%. Software sales were reportedly 70/30 in favour of the ST.&#xA;A small South Wales company called Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) was about to release a Spectrum &amp;ldquo;super clone&amp;rdquo;.</description>

The ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine but was now accepting that it&amp;rsquo;s destiny would be games.&#xA;Sugar&amp;rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch&amp;rsquo;s Sky satellite TV company which would see Amstrad producing and selling £199 dishes that would receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following year.</description>

      <description>News Huge news arrived just hours before this issue went to press - Amstrad had bought Sinclair for meagre £5 million. What would this mean for Sinclair products? The QL and microdrive would be likely casualties, but it sounded like Amstrad had promising plans for the Spectrum. Overall it was taken as a positive happening, though the alternative would&amp;rsquo;ve been receivership for Sinclair. Sir Clive himself was to return to research.</description>

      <description>News Not games related as such, but May saw the launch of C&amp;amp;VG&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Bring Back the Doctor&amp;rdquo; campaign after the BBC announced Doctor Who was to end. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the BBC had specified when this was to happen, as it would last another 4 years.&#xA;The &amp;ldquo;Designer of the Month&amp;rdquo; was Stephen Redman, a 21 year old uni student who released the somewhat controversial (how innocent we all were) game &amp;ldquo;A Day in the Life&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>News Rare had been inundated with calls from developers wanting in on the Nintendo market and the Z80 arcade board that they (Rare) were working on. This all follows on from a pretty amazing interview with Rare in the previous issue of TGM - amazing because it was the first (and perhaps only?) proper interview conducted with the Stamper brothers. Everyone had been wondering what happened to Ultimate Play The Game (arguably the finest developer of the 8bit years), and now we all knew.</description>

      <description>Compared to the previous few months, there seemed like a relative dearth of good games released for the Spectrum. Crash pondered whether this had anything to do with the recent release of the Spectrum 128K. Game compilations (often tied to a charity) were coming out at a ridiculous rate - would this result in the cost of games for the consumer (typically kids) going down? or will the revenue developers see take a big hit as people choose cheap compilations over &amp;ldquo;single&amp;rdquo; release games?</description>
