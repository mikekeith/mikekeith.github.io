            <strong>News</strong> Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than ever&rdquo;. A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put in a bid for £5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows. Retailer Silica were staying the course...

            <strong>News</strong> The One had had a bit of a facelift with the Contents page getting a re- design, along with various sections getting re-labelled. The big news for the month was that Commodore UK had announced a new Amiga: the A1(M). The specs included &ldquo;32 megabytes of RAM, a 1 gigabyte hard drive, 32-bit graphics card, 64-bit processor, 8x speed CD-ROM drive&rdquo;. And of course it was The One&rsquo;s...

            <strong>News</strong> Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role. If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month, then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the lack of new stock. With that said,...

It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo; The fate...

            <strong>News</strong> While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a “buying show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left...

In the latest twist, word arrived Commodore UK (lead by David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot) were now the favourites with their proposal of a Management Buy Out, with Samsung apparently still keen.

It seemed everything was hanging on that deal. Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;. A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last year. The market value...

Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&rsquo;t terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well.

            <strong>News</strong> Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a reboot of Sinclair User&hellip; which made a little more sense. Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad, their budget label. The lineup included “Cannon Fodder”, “Dune”, “Dune 2”, “Jimmy White’s Whirlwind...

            <strong>News</strong> This was to be David Upchurch&rsquo;s last issue as Editor as off to head up EMAP&rsquo;s relaunch of&hellip; Sinclair User. Apparently the Speccy had been seeing a resurgence, though I find that a little hard to believe. At any rate, Simon Byron was to take over the helm. Team 17 were embracing the CD32 starting with &ldquo;Ultimate Body Blows&rdquo;, a revamped version of their beat&rsquo;em up featuring...

            <strong>News</strong> Editor David Upchurch saw a bright 1994 ahead for the Amiga. Word on the street was that Commodore UK were close to striking a deal with LucasArts that would see them bring their PC hits &ldquo;Rebel Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Day of the Tentacle&rdquo; to the CD32.

            <strong>News</strong> Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting &ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo; to the Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation? It looked like &ldquo;The Second Samurai&rdquo; would be Vivid Image Design&rsquo;s last title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and illustration...

The CD32 received some encouraging news as high street retailer Menzies announced they would be stocking it in time for Christmas. After some months of silence (on the Amiga at any rate), Thalamus was about to release “S.U.B.” (unreleased). The One wondered what had happened to “Arsenal” - rumour was...

To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &lsquo;93 exhibition and an upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &lsquo;93 was such a big hit that...

            <strong>News</strong> Digital Image Design had two new titles on the way. The first up was a &ldquo;pseudo-sequel&rdquo; to &ldquo;Epic&rdquo; - called &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; - set 90 years further in the future and would feature more of an open world feel.

            <strong>News</strong> The European Computer Entertainment show was on, then off, then back on. Editor Ciaran Brennan pondered the dearth of releases for this time of year. Were publishers simply holding them for Christmas? Judging by the slew of previews and announcements it certainly looked like there was plenty on the way. French developer Delphine were touting their new animation system, Cinematique. The first game to utilise it would be...

The much hyped Konix Multisystem was going to be available to buy this month at stores across the UK for around 200 quid. Not all of the eagerly anticipated peripherals would be on sale to start with - the hydraulic chair was &ldquo;on the horizon&rdquo; and expected to cost another 200 quid. Of course, sadly, none of...

            <strong>News</strong> Two years after it launched in the US, Atari were bringing the 7800 ProSystem to the UK. On paper the specs weren&rsquo;t up to much when compared to Nintendo and Sega&rsquo;s offerings, but at £69.95 it looked decent value for money. Stateside the 7800 was the number 2 selling console ahead of the Master System. Spectravideo&rsquo;s popular range of Quickshot joysticks (the Quickshot II Turbo was my personal...

Others were expected to follow suit, though that did seem somewhat unlikely as that’s a steep drop down from £9.95.

            <strong>News</strong> Gary Penn responded to grumblings from readers about the Christmas issue. The main complaints were around the lack of reviews and the price. The former issue was hardly the magazine’s fault as publisher’s were taking any morsel of time they could get in order to get games on the shelves for the Christmas shoppers. Electric Dreams/Activision had a whopping dozen licensed arcade conversions heading to the C64. They...

            <strong>News</strong> &ldquo;Death Stalks the Night&rdquo; was an upcoming arcade adventure from Ubi Soft where the player assumed the role as Count Dracula to take on “the usual Van Helsings”. New software house EAS announced a space trading game called &ldquo;STAG&rdquo; for the Amiga and ST. Mr Chip’s &ldquo;Wrangler&quot;would see the player take control over Clint Eastwood (yes, apparently) and his ‘droid in what looked like a puzzle game. Budget...

            <strong>News</strong> In his editorial, Gary Penn lamented the fact that for the first time there had not been a single Sizzler or Gold Medal awarded in an issue. Well, that’s not entirely true as &ldquo;The Bard’s Tale&rdquo; picked up a very respectable Sizzler, though apparently it didn’t count as it was “a role playing game”. It seemed that software houses were spending as much time as possible before Christmas...

            <strong>News</strong> The Commodore Show in London was the biggest dedicated C64 event of the year. Zzap!&rsquo;s own booth proved very popular - especially when games programmers dropped by to show off their latest wares (often yet to be signed to a publisher).

It really was oddly vitriolic and included such gems as: &ldquo;&hellip; a certain kind of magazine should only be handled with rubber gloves and antiseptic fire tongs.

            <strong>News</strong> Leading this month&rsquo;s news was US Gold&rsquo;s &ldquo;World Cup Carnival&rdquo;, the official World Cup &lsquo;86 game. A team of programmers had been working on it for 6 months and US Gold boldly claimed that it would &ldquo;reach new standards in football simulation&rdquo;. Sadly it would turn out to be one of the most infamously terrible games of the time, and was just a repackaging of an older title....

            <strong>News</strong> Activision announced &ldquo;Murder on the Missippisic&quot;81, which was being written by Adam Bellin. Rather oddly C&amp;VG described Bellin as &ldquo;part of the team who produced the controversial &lsquo;Ghostbusters&rsquo;&rdquo;. I have no idea what the controversy was. &ldquo;Dr Blitzen and the Islands of Arcanum&rdquo; would be the followup to the popular &ldquo;Dynamite Dan&rdquo;. Alligata released &ldquo;Who Dares Wins II&rdquo;. Colin McLinton won Firebird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; competition. There were 11 finalists,...

            <strong>News</strong> One year and two months after Newsfield launched LM, the decision was made to end the experiment. Only 4 issues of the ambitious magazine were published and it had struggled to gain the support of ad agencies and their clients. The magazine had set out to cover &ldquo;every aspect of life&rdquo; for the youth audience, but was seen as being &ldquo;too widely targeted&rdquo; by advertisers, despite healthy sales....

            <strong>News</strong> With yet more consolidation of software houses, Graeme Kidd painted a rather bleak outlook for innovative and original games. Fewer, bigger companies spending more and more on licenses and marketing meant there was little room for fresh ideas. The only hope, in his eyes, was a system much like book publishing where &ldquo;authors tout their wares around the large publishers.&rdquo; More tweaks were made to Crash&rsquo;s review process....

            <strong>News</strong> With the news that Ultimate had morphed into Rare and committed exclusively to consoles - due to hit the UK in the coming months - and the arrival of powerful 16bit machines, Graeme Kidd tried allay the fears of readers about the future of the Speccy. A swath of top quality games had come out for the Spectrum in the last few months of 1986 and Graeme reckoned...

Domark released a screenshot of their rather controversial &ldquo;Friday the 13th&rdquo;. The game certainly got the attention of the press but - unsurprisingly - for all the wrong reasons, as it turned out to be rubbish. (&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear&rdquo; lamented Crash in their review).

Neither the NES or Master System had managed to gain much of a foothold in the UK - both machines selling around 45,000 units each - but the tide did seem to be turning. Code Masters were rather bullish about the console market, with Operations Manager Bruce Everiss being particularly...
