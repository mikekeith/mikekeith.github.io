      <description>The good folk behind the absolutely brilliant &amp;ldquo;From Bedrooms to Billions&amp;rdquo; documentary have announced their new project: a 90 minute film on the Amiga. This time rather than focussing on the British contribution to the industry, they&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking to prominent Amiga developers, musicians, demo sceners and so on from around the world.&#xA;Given my love for the Amiga - a machine that was so beautifully and elegantly architected and years ahead of its time - I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely delighted they&amp;rsquo;ve chosen it as the subject.</description>

      <description>A little over 2 years ago I stumbled across an Indiegogo campaign that was raising funds for a documentary on the birth of the UK games industry. They already had an impressive list of interviewees lined up and the clips they&amp;rsquo;d released were very promising. It was clear that the producers had a deep respect for the subject and the people they were recording, and that they weren&amp;rsquo;t setting out to create some cheesey fluff piece (unlike certain other productions).</description>

      <description>After a successful round of crowdfunding last year, the people behind the &amp;ldquo;From Bedrooms to Billions&amp;rdquo; documentary and conducting a new Kickstarter campaign in order to cover the myriad of costs involved in finishing and polishing the film. With the passing of Mike Singleton, it&amp;rsquo;s become clear that we need to record the histories of the people involved in the UK games industry during the 80s. The interviews they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to snag are extremely impressive - so many of my heroes are in there.</description>
