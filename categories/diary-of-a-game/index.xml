      <description>Since my last update work has been a bit quieter post-ship and I enjoyed an unexpectedly low key Christmas break, so surely I&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress, right? Well&amp;hellip; life decided to intervene which resulted in a lot less time to work on the game than I had hoped. But I have managed to tick off a few things on the long to-do list&amp;hellip;&#xA;Item Activation The main - and, I must admit, only - playing facing addition is items that need to be activated before they can be matched.</description>

      <description>Good grief, in my mind my last update was 3, maybe 4, months ago&amp;hellip; but May?! Well, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve had a decent excuse.&#xA;Despite being embarassingly tardy with writing updates, some progress has been made. This is the current state of the game:&#xA;Sprites I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to stick with the C64&amp;rsquo;s standard character mode - I may well switch to the multicolour character mode, but a character approach seems to be working well.</description>

      <description>Once again a depressing amount of time has passed since my last update. Given what&amp;rsquo;s on my plate workwise over the next few months I suspect the sporadic nature of my posts will continue. Thankfully I have continued to find time to chip away at the game, and some progress has been made.&#xA;After I managed to get a super rough first pass of the (very) initial base of the game done (with the balls/bubbles/whatever falling down the board and stacking up correctly), the next thing to tackle was the colour matching.</description>

      <description>Man, what happened to the last couple of months?! In the first part of this series I mentioned that my work tended to be rather full on.. at that point I knew I was going to be spending the end of January traveling on business, but what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know was that that would be immediately followed by another, longer business trip. I had a whole 4 days at home during February, and not a single weekend.</description>

      <description>Here is the first screenshot of a new game I&amp;rsquo;m working on - awesome eh? Wait, don&amp;rsquo;t walk away! It&amp;rsquo;ll get better, I promise!&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 23 years working in the games industry and at various points I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted to muster the motivation/energy to create a game in my spare time. Only one of those (a simple iPhone game, no longer available) made it through to the end and even that took way too long.</description>
