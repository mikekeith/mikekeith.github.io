<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>This month saw C&amp;VG turn 5 years old and to celebrate they had a bunch of
special features, including a Spectrum listing by Steve Turner&rsquo;s dad.</p>
<p>Microsphere revealed their next game would be <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001055">&ldquo;Contact Sam Cruise&rdquo;</a>,
which was inspired by classic private eye movies. There was also a hint that
there might be something for fans of <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004549">&ldquo;Skool Daze&rdquo;</a> at Christmas.</p>
<p>Arioalasoft got the licenses for two Hanna-Barbera cartoons: <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3027">&ldquo;The
Centurions&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1063">&ldquo;The Challenge of the Gobots&rdquo;</a>. The games were
due in December.</p>
<p>Durrell announced <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005218">&ldquo;Thanatos&rdquo;</a> in which the player played as a dragon.
Oddly enough C&amp;VG included two screenshots for it, but one was the title
screen of <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001736">&ldquo;Fat Worm Blows a Sparky&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Domark had found considerable success with their <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005423">&ldquo;Trivial Pursuit&rdquo;</a>
adaptation and were planning to release several additional editions, the first
of which would be <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005426">&ldquo;Young Players&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>US Gold and Data East were bringing the arcade game <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=367">&ldquo;Breakthru&rdquo;</a> to
home computers.</p>
<p>Mike Singleton was working on <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005243">&ldquo;Throne of Fire&rdquo;</a> for Melbourne House
which would feature a split screen allowing either one or two player gaming.
Rumours were that Mike was also working on a &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; arcade game
with the same publisher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Melbourne House was finishing up <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1306">&ldquo;Inspector Gadget&rdquo;</a>, based
on the cartoon of the same name, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=242">&ldquo;Bazooka Bill&rdquo;</a>, and the long awaited
<a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1390">&ldquo;Judge Dredd&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG drooled over Palace&rsquo;s rather beautiful <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=121">&ldquo;Sacred Armour of
Antiriad&rdquo;</a> that was coming soon for the C64.</p>
<p>Mark Cale claimed System 3&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=746">&ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;</a> would be &ldquo;unlike
anything yet seen on computer&rdquo;. Other games on the way from the software house
were <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=212">&ldquo;Bangkok Knights&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1488">&ldquo;The Last Ninja&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The next adventure up from St Brides <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006050">&ldquo;Bugsy&rdquo;</a> would see the player
assume the form of a blue rabbit attempting to build a criminal career in the
1920s.</p>
<p>Pete Cooke&rsquo;s followup to the excellent <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005153">&ldquo;Tau Ceti&rdquo;</a> was to be a prequel
set in Gal-Corp&rsquo;s Skimmer pilot academy. <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005156">&ldquo;Academy&rdquo;</a> would sport some
very impressive features (like a completely customisable HUD) and 20 different
missions.</p>
<p>Mev Dinc (&ldquo;Mev Ding&rdquo; according the snippet) named the 3D isometric scrolling
routines in his new game, <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003892">&ldquo;Prodigy&rdquo;</a> &ldquo;Mechavision&rdquo; (hard to say what
was different from the existing Ultimate isometric games)</p>
<p>US Gold looked to be doing a fine job with their <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1031">&ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;</a> conversion
and C&amp;VG predicted it would be a number one hit. Also in time for Christmas
would be the brilliant <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2894">&ldquo;World Games&rdquo;</a> - interestingly enough arriving
on the ST first, followed by the C64 and Spectrum.</p>
<p>Martin Walker&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=451">&ldquo;Chameleon&rdquo;</a> was due for release this month.</p>
<p>Continuing in their tradition of film and TV licenses, Ocean were bringing out
a game based on <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005332">&ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo;</a>. The movie hadn&rsquo;t been released in the UK
yet, but it&rsquo;d certainly done well in the US.</p>
<p>Level 9 had been working with the scriptwriters of The Archers to produce <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005957">an
adventure game</a> based on the radio series.</p>
<p>Martech&rsquo;s next title due out this month would be <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2604">&ldquo;Tarzan&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=577">&ldquo;Crystal Castles&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1702">&ldquo;Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo;</a> had been out in
the US for a while but were finally going to hit the UK shelves thanks to US
Gold.</p>
<p>Tony Takoushi raved about <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1276">&ldquo;Marble Madness&rdquo;</a> on the Amiga.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>C&amp;VG looked into how Rod Pike&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=763">&ldquo;Dracula&rdquo;</a> came about and reviewed it,
even though the copy they had was lacking any graphics (which would turn out
to be rather controversial indeed). They scored it 8/10.</p>
<p>There was a rather incomprehensible piece on the beginnings of C&amp;VG which was
presented as a Star Trek themed dream.</p>
<p>Mel Croucher provided a characteristically off the wall summary of the past 5
years and his vision of the 5 to come. He ended it by saying &ldquo;Why are we still
in this industry five years on? Because, gentle reader, we love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keith Campbell took a look at 5 years of adventure games.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG presented their &ldquo;birthday honours&rdquo; list:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Review C&amp;VG Got Wrong - <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1704">&ldquo;Monty Mole&rdquo;</a> Gremlin Graphics</li>
<li>Longest Surviving Software House - Level 9, Hewson and Mikro-Gen</li>
<li>Most Innovative Software House - Ultimate (although the prize actually was accepted by Geoff Brown of US Gold who had bought the rights to the Ultimate name and catalogue)</li>
</ul>
<p>There was a look back at all the computers/systems C&amp;VG had covered in their 5
years, most of which had long disappeared.</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=88">&ldquo;Aliens (UK)&rdquo;</a> Electric Dreams</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005423">&ldquo;Trivial Pursuit&rdquo;</a> Domark - Spectrum/C64/Amstrad/BBC 10/10 Game of the Month &ldquo;Trivial Pursuit on computer is as much fun to play as the original - and the graphics and sound add a whole new dimension. TP will make a far from trivial addition to your games collection.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=616">&ldquo;Dan Dare&rdquo;</a> Virgin - C64 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Now as I said last issue, Dan Dare on the 64 is a totally different game from the Spectrum/Amstrad versions. But fear not, it&rsquo;s just as good, in fact it may be better.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0009297">&ldquo;1942&rdquo;</a> Elite - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;This is an extremely satisfying and very playable bit of arcade action.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=95">&ldquo;Alleykat&rdquo;</a> Andrew Braybrook/Hewson - C64 8/10 &ldquo;Alleykat is a cracking game. There is detail, speedy gameplay, and enough depth to keep you coming back for more.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=787">&ldquo;Druid&rdquo;</a> Firebird - C64 9/10 &ldquo;I say Druid is great, and those of you who like Gauntlet can have real fun without putting pounds into the arcade machines. Me, I&rsquo;ll wait for the official Gauntlet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001054">&ldquo;Conquestador&rdquo;</a> Melbourne House/ERBE - Spectrum 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Conquestador is a classic arcade adventure which would grace even the most choosy gamesters collection. It looks good, sounds good, and by golly it does you good!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004240">&ldquo;Room 10&rdquo;</a> Pete Cooke/CRL - C64/Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;Room 10 must be one of the most obscure titles ever for a game. It tells absolutely nothing about this new and excellent variation on the bat and ball game.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005388">&ldquo;The Trap Door&rdquo;</a> Don Priestly/Pirahna - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;The Trap Door is a brilliant game - one of the most original and entertaining I&rsquo;ve seen for ages.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=642">&ldquo;Deactivators&rdquo;</a> Ariolasoft/Reaktor - C64/Spectrum/Amstrad 10/10 &ldquo;Deactivators is a demanding, challenging and original game. It requires quick thinking and fast reactions. I was hooked from the moment I started playing. Deactivators is destined to become a cult game.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002258">&ldquo;Head Coach&rdquo;</a> Addictive - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;Head Coach will appeal to American Football fans with strategic minds and owners of Addictive&rsquo;s other classic soccer simulation.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1503">&ldquo;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&rdquo;</a> - C64/Atari 9/10 &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re under-18, or not very broad minded, you shouldn&rsquo;t even think of playing this game - in fact, you shouldn&rsquo;t even be reading this review.&rdquo; (It was a strange review in that there was nothing terribly positive said about the game)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006706">&ldquo;Moron&rdquo;</a> Atlantis Software - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;It has to be said Atlantis have done it again! There&rsquo;s plenty of adventure there for your £1.99, and it&rsquo;s worth playing!&rdquo;</li>
