<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>This month saw a new &ldquo;bigger and brighter&rdquo; look for TGM.</p>
<p>Excitement was growing for the impending release of the Konix Slipstream
megaconsole. Costing a mere Â£149 it was due to go on sale in Autumn and would
be able to read software from standard 3&quot; disks as well as cartridges. Disks
were looking like the preferred format due to being much cheaper to produce -
customers could look forward to paying only 15 quid for games. The CPU was
previously thought to be an 8086, but it was now revealed they were going with
a 68000. This would be accompanied by 4 customised co-processors and an
&ldquo;extremely fast&rdquo; (70 mips) blitter. Peripherals lined up for launch included
the hydraulic chair and 3D helmet.</p>
<p>In other vapourware news, Atari promised a sub-Â£100 console built with ST
technology for the middle of the year. Not to be out done by announcing
products that would never see the light of day, Commodore announced a new
Amiga/PC hybrid - the 2000AT. The machine would feature an IBM PC-AT emulation
mode to enable it to run all PC software, and would cost Â£1500.</p>
<p>US Gold managed to grab the rights to publish Lucasfilm games in the UK from
Domark.</p>
<p>Boots refused to stock System 3&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1489">&ldquo;Last Ninja 2&rdquo;</a> after the software
house put rubber shurikens in 25,000 &ldquo;limited edition&rdquo; copies of the game.
Other retailers were reportedly removing the offending items by hand or
placing warning stickers on the boxes.</p>
<p>Problems came to light with Amstrad&rsquo;s new Spectrum +2 (known as the +2A). Due
to a change in the positions of expansion slots and a lack of 9V output to
power peripherals, many 3rd party add-ons could not be used. To make matters
worse, changes to the OS resulted in incompatibilities in some software.
Amstrad&rsquo;s woes didn&rsquo;t end there: customers who forked over Â£343 for a new
Sinclair Professional PC 200 discovered MS-DOS, the GEM 3 environment and GW-
BASIC were missing from the package. This was apparently due to a delay which
would be rectified soon, but that probably wasn&rsquo;t much comfort to those who
found themselves with effectively useless computers.</p>
<p>Audiogenic were to try to attract more women by publishing &ldquo;cuddly games&rdquo; and
sports simulations with female athletes as sponsors. &ldquo;I think the whole aura
that surrounds computers is male-oriented. Even when you have got women
involved they tend to get desensitised and brainwashed,&rdquo; observed Managing
Director Peter Calver.</p>
<p>Printer prices were set to rise significantly - up to 47% more - after the EEC
ruled that Japanese manufacturers were unfairly undercutting European and
American competitors.</p>
<p>VAT came into effect in the UK this month.</p>
<p>Sony, Panasonic and Sanyo had all released new MSX 2+ computers in order to
compete with the Amiga &amp; ST. Technically they were impressive in someways
(19268 colours), but less so in others (the CPU was an 8-bit Z80). There was
no date given when they would be available in the UK.</p>
<p>After having to pull copies of their side scrolling shooter <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=627">&ldquo;Katakis&rdquo;</a>
from the shelves due to legal action for similarities to &ldquo;R-Type&rdquo;, US Gold
revealed the German developers (Rainbow Arts, with Factor 5 handling the Amiga
conversion) were hard at work rewriting it so it would be totally legal.
Factor 5 changed the gameplay and levels &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; and the game was re-
released as <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=317">&ldquo;Denaris&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marshal M Rosenthal attended the Commodore show in Philadelphia. The vibe at the show was extremely positive, with a lot of excitement for the potential of the Amiga machines. Judging by what was on show, it seemed that this was the dawning of a new age for artists in particular. The C64 was represented, but had been very much relegated to the side lines.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Gift of the Guppie&rdquo; was the title of an article by Mel Croucher which looked at some recent examples of stupid gizmos for gullible people with too much money.</li>
<li>Rob Steel took a look back the adventure game highlights and lowlights of 1988.</li>
<li>A rather odd piece on &ldquo;PCA&rdquo; from The Electric Ephemeiris which was a fully feature astrological application. Some alternative software was mentioned as well as reading material.</li>
<li>A look at the technical details of the upcoming SAM Coupe machine which could run much Spectrum software while boasting 256K RAM, 64 colours and 7 channel sound.</li>
<li>With the Konix Slipstream, rumoured Sega Megadelve [sic] and Nintendo II machines due to hit the high street in the coming months, TGM pondered what it would take for a new machine to be successful against such stiff competition. Could Acorn turn the failing Archimedes around? Did the SAM Coupe stand a chance?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;RC Pro-Am&rdquo; Rare - NES 85% &ldquo;Heavily into Nintendo for some years now, Rare haven&rsquo;t lost any of their brilliance or innovation.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=985">&ldquo;Speedball&rdquo;</a> Bitmap Brothers/Imageworks - Amiga 86% &ldquo;Speedball takes the general format of computerised team games and adds gratuitous violence and speed. Result: things go at a hectic pace, the ball rebounds all over the arena and game-flow is only hindered by the computer occasionally selecting the player who isn&rsquo;t nearest the ball.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1489">&ldquo;Last Ninja 2&rdquo;</a> System 3 - C64 93% Spectrum 89% &ldquo;Overall, Last Ninja 2 would make an excellent addition to any arcade-adventurer&rsquo;s collection.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002813">&ldquo;Laser Squad&rdquo;</a> Target Games - Spectrum 84% &ldquo;Through the combination of tactical play and arcade graphics, Laser Squad certainly stands out from the rest.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005340">&ldquo;Total Eclipse&rdquo;</a> Incentive - Spectrum 91% CPC 92% &ldquo;Total Eclipse is the best yet from Incentive. The puzzles, tricks and traps of an Egyptian tomb merged with the incredibly atmospheric 3D solid graphics of Freescape make it a magical experience - a program not to be missed.&rdquo;</li>
