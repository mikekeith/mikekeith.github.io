<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Word leaked out that Epyx was working on a new console. David Morse (CEO of
Epyx, and one of the original Amiga hardware designers) was involved on what
was rumoured to be a new handheld. This, of course, would become the Atari
Lynx.</p>
<p>Megadrives and NES consoles started appearing in arcades in the UK where
players could purchase a set amount of play time with a range of games
available.</p>
<p>The European launch of the MSX-2+ was set for the Hannover Computer Show this
month.</p>
<p>Miles Gordon Technology said they planned to release an enhanced machine after
the upcoming SAM Coupe.</p>
<p>FAST (Federation Against Software Theft) claimed to have taken back Â£250,000
worth of pirated software.</p>
<p>The Advertising Standards Authority cracked down on sexist advertising.
Unsurprisingly, <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003920">&ldquo;Psycho Pigs U.X.B.&rdquo;</a> was the main example.</p>
<p>A new group was founded to try to combat the increasingly male dominated games
industry. The Organisation Against Sexism In Software planned to campaign to
get &ldquo;antisexist&rdquo; software on the shelves.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Excitement had reached fever pitch for the imminent arrival of the Konix Multi-System - the greatest console that never was. The cover of the magazine promised a &ldquo;full review&rdquo; but instead TGM devoted four pages with info and quotes from Konix boss Wyn Holloway. There were some slightly odd things, like how the machine only needed 128K RAM because it had a special processor that could load from 3.5&quot; floppies in the background. In hindsight it was clear that things were not quite as they seemed.</li>
<li>Mel Croucher looked at smart cards and their various uses.</li>
<li>The second instalment of the development diary of Argonaut&rsquo;s new game (known as &ldquo;X&rdquo;, but would be released as <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=163">&ldquo;Birds of Prey&rdquo;</a>). This time the focus was on the HUD and the great lengths the team had to go to to find information about real fighter HUDs.</li>
<li>Somewhat ironically (in hindsight) for an issue with heavy coverage of the Konix, Robin Candy looked at hyped up products that failed to arrive. Psyclapse and Bandersnatch were obvious examples, but also Gargoyle Games&rsquo;s Siege of Earth trilogy (<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003040">&ldquo;Marsport&rdquo;</a> was the only part released), the Flare One console (the team went to work on the Konix) and a few others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li>Palace Software had a full line up on the way. <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=277">&ldquo;Cosmic Pirate&rdquo;</a> by Zippo Games for Amiga/ST/C64/Spectrum/Amstrad, &ldquo;Astounding Astral Adventures&rdquo; (working title - doesn&rsquo;t appear it was released) for the Amiga from the visual fx folk behind the movie &ldquo;High Spirits&rdquo;, &ldquo;Superthief&rdquo; (again, no sign of it) by Dan Malone, and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=948">&ldquo;Shoot&rsquo;em Up Construction Kit&rdquo;</a> for Amiga/ST/C64 by Sensible Software. Gary Carr (who did the graphics for <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=213">&ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;</a>) was working on &ldquo;Monster Menu&rdquo;, and they also had a game called &ldquo;Complex&rdquo;. Neither of these two appear to have been released.</li>
<li>A new kind of game was promised by Electronic Arts, who released details about a &ldquo;god simulator&rdquo; from Bullfrog. This was, of course, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=855">&ldquo;Populous&rdquo;</a>.</li>
<li>Rainbow Arts had created a new label, Golden Goblins, and the first release would be <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=456">&ldquo;Grand Monster Slam&rdquo;</a> for the Amiga/ST.</li>
<li>Don Priestly&rsquo;s next game would be &ldquo;Mad Flunky&rdquo;, an ST only version of his <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001809">&ldquo;Flunky&rdquo;</a> game for the Spectrum.</li>
<li>Cinemaware was to release one of the first ever CD-ROM games with &ldquo;Defender of the Crown&rdquo; for the PC.</li>
<li>Lucasfilm was working on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=137">&ldquo;Battlehawks 1942&rdquo;</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1162">&ldquo;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&rdquo;</a> Lucasfilm Games - Amiga/64/PC 81% &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty to do in each location. Zak&rsquo;s bedroom alone conceals a number of necessary objects and some intriguing loose floorboards.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1085">&ldquo;TV Sports: Football&rdquo;</a> Cinemaware - Amiga 90% &ldquo;This is an unmissable simulation for those with an American Football bent.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1739">&ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Lair&rdquo;</a> ReadySoft - Amiga 81% &ldquo;Considering Journey Into The Lair costs Â£120 plus the price of a laser disc player - Amiga owners aren&rsquo;t paying too high a price as both graphics and sound are as close to the original as anyone could reasonably expect.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nemesis III: The Eve of Destruction&rdquo; Konami - MSX 86% &ldquo;With presentation, atmosphere and features to parallel coin-op quality, Nemesis III is the best of the series yet.&rdquo;</li>
