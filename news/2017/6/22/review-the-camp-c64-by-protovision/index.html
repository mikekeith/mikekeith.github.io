<p>Way back in the mists of time (well, 1982) my parents took me and my sister
out of school for a few months to embark on a trip around the UK, Europe and
the US. For the European leg we jaunted about in a campervan, staying at
campsites (and occasionally on roadsides) along the way. My memories of that
time are sadly vague - my main recollection is the ridiculously rough toilet
paper that one had to endure in the bathrooms. I‚Äôm talking really rough. Like
coarse sandpaper. I forget what town it was, but I actually kept a piece of it
in my jacket pocket to remind me of the horrors, and it was still intact when
we got home.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-22-2017622review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/image-asset.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The setting for this game is based on an actual German campsite the creator(s)
spent time at during their formative years, and there is a nice nostalgic feel
to it all. Along with the disk (in a rather nicely decorated sleeve), the
package includes a campsite newsletter, a beer mat, a lump of charcoal wrapped
in foil, a peppermint teabag and, yes, a piece of camp toilet paper (though an
acceptably soft piece - I guess the world has progressed&hellip; or maybe we were
staying at the wrong campsites). Unsurprisingly, one should read through the
newsletter as it does contain some important clues.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-22-2017622review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/image-asset-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The adventure begins with the player waking up in a dark hut with a terrible
headache, and it soon becomes apparent that your friends and the camp staff
have all disappeared. Looks like it‚Äôs going to fall on you to figure out what
happened to them.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="http://csdb.dk/group/?id=8060">TUGCS (The United German Commodore Service)</a> using the
<a href="https://www.protovision.games/games/d42.php?language=en">‚ÄúD42 Adventure System‚Äù</a> for <a href="http://csdb.dk/event/?id=2307">FORUM64‚Äôs 2015 Adventure
competition</a>, the game was picked up for a proper release by
<a href="https://www.protovision.games">Protovision</a>. Rather than the player entering text commands, there are
a small number of actions, some of which take one or two objects to act on.
This certainly reduces the frustration of trying to guess specific words on
top of tackling the puzzle at hand, but there are some weird inconsistencies
(e.g. in one puzzle it was surely possible to both move or open a particular
object, but only one verb was accepted).</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-22-2017622review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/image-asset-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Each location is accompanied by a picture, the quality of which varies a bit,
but overall they‚Äôre good. Adding to the atmosphere is the sound - both FX and
some decent tunes. I got the impression these are significant, but I must
admit I could never quite figure out in what way.</p>

<p>One of several amusing Bush related jokes.</p>
<p>I found the humour to be rather fun. I don‚Äôt mean this in a bad way, but it is
very German, and often reminded me of amusing things my German friends say. I
suspect there are number of in jokes that completely passed me by - it was
always hard to tell if I was missing something or whether the translation
didn‚Äôt quite work. There are a tonne of 80s references, most of which I‚Äôm
pleased to say I got.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-22-2017622review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/image-asset-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The game is unforgiving, and makes no bones about it. In fact, soon after you
start it nudges you to perform an action and then gleefully points out you
should‚Äôve saved before hand. That‚Äôs not the last time you can do something
which seems innocuous, yet will eventually prevent the game from being
completed.</p>
<p>Due to the graphics and sound, moving between locations always incurs a disk
load, and with the game split between two disk sides this can be a bit
tedious. I first fired it up on one of my real C64s, but soon switched to an
emulator, bumping up the CPU speed during loads.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-22-2017622review-the-camp-c64-by-protovision/image-asset-5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôve played a fair number of adventure games in my time (though I don‚Äôt
consider myself an expert), and there were a small number of - in my opinion -
completely baffling puzzles. I managed to get quite someway into the game
before throwing up my hands and searching the internet for hints. The funny
thing is that even having discovered <a href="http://www.mogelpower.de/cheats/loesung.php?id=40880">a walkthrough</a>, the fact that it
was in German combined with said puzzles not making much sense, there was
still plenty of figuring out to be done.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest annoyance is that the exits of some locations don‚Äôt make
any geographic sense - e.g. you go north, then continue north, and end up back
where you started.</p>
<p>Gripes aside, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had here. Given that this was
a compo entry, I was impressed as to the number of locations and general
quality of puzzles.</p>
<p>I love the fact that in this day and age a C64 adventure was created and sold
in a package with Infocom-style ‚Äúfeelies‚Äù‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs even more impressive
considering that this is a translation from the German original.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Camp&rdquo; can be <a href="https://www.protovision.games/games/das_camp.php?language=en">purchased direct from Protovision</a>.</p>
