<p>[Oh dear, I got confused and thought this was the April issue.. turns out my
April issue appears to be missing - no doubt the fault of one of my High
School friends back in the day]</p>
<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Rignall and Glancey took on Domark’s Mark Strachan and Andy Blazdell in three
rounds of Tengen’s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1110">&ldquo;Vindicators&rdquo;</a> arcade machine. The C&amp;VG lads won two
out of three and claimed the Tengen Trophy. A rematch was planned, this time
with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=74">&ldquo;APB”</a>, though would be delayed after the delivery men dropped
Domark’s cabinet and smashed it to pieces.</p>
<p>Palace Software struck a deal with Delphine to distribute their games outside
of France, the first of which would be <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=161">&ldquo;Bio Challenge”</a>.</p>
<p>Silverbird’s new “123 Pack” was a budget compilation costing a mere £2.99.
Mind you, as C&amp;VG noted, none of the games included were all that great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deluxe Paint III&rdquo; landed and featured a bevvy of new features and
enhancements, particularly in the animation department.</p>
<p>Kid’s TV host Gilbert the “mucus king” was to star in his own videogame called
<a href="http://hol.abime.net/2726" title="Escape From Drill">”Escape From Drill“</a> courtesy of newcomers Enigma Variations.</p>
<p>Sensible Software’s next title would be a budget title on the Rack-It label.
Titled<a href="http://hol.abime.net/2642">”Insects in Space&rdquo;</a> it was their “loopy” take on Stargate.</p>
<p>Fresh on the heels of their well received <a href="http://hol.abime.net/2099">&ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;</a> conversions, Vektor Graphics teased their new flight sim <a href="http://hol.abime.net/307">&ldquo;Bomber&rdquo;</a> (working title).</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.abime.net/3176">&ldquo;AAARGH!&rdquo;</a> from Melbourne House would see the player take on the role
of a giant monster indulging in some good old city stomping.</p>
<p>Super Mario Brothers on the go?! Nintendo had just launched the Game Boy in
Japan.</p>
<p>Arcana went all out with the press pack for &ldquo;Mars Cops”. The game had suffered
many delays and re-writes over the course of two years, but was finally ready
for release. Actually, <a href="http://www.gamesthatwerent.com/gtw64/mars-cops/">no it wasn’t</a>.</p>
<p>After making the move to California and leaving the UK game scene behind, it
was revealed that Rob Hubbard had written the soundtrack to
<a href="http://hol.abime.net/1102">&ldquo;Populous”</a>.</p>
<p>The Akai U5 Professional was a walkman sized recording studio, allowing the
user to lay down four tracks on to a standard cassette.</p>
<p>Ocean snapped up three more licenses: <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004072">&ldquo;Red Heat”</a>, <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000903">&ldquo;Chase HQ&rdquo;</a>
and <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003415">&ldquo;Nightbreed”</a>.</p>
<p>Canon’s A1 Note was a digital notepad with a high-res LCD screen and a stylus.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>There was a super bizarre and kinda gross ad from Microprose for <a href="http://hol.abime.net/2467">&ldquo;Microprose
Soccer”</a>. It was at the start of the game reviews, looked exactly like a
C&amp;VG review and awarded itself C&amp;VG Game of the Month. It did state “This is
not a C&amp;VG Review” but still… gross.</p>
<p>The movies reviewed this month were: “Alien Nation”, “My Stepmother is an
Alien”, “The Tall Guy”, “Crossing Delancey”, “Punchline”, “Without a Clue”,
“The Dead Pool”, “Patty Hearst”, “The Year My Voice Broke”, “Matewan”, “Da”
and “Stealing Heaven”.</p>
<p>Julian Rignall was very impressed with Sega’s new console, the Mega-Drive.</p>
<p>John Minson ranted about an article that appeared in The Sunday Times about
how computers were corrupting kids with hardcore porn, and the fact that C&amp;VG
had fallen foul of Germany’s censors for covering war games.</p>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001425">&ldquo;Dominator&rdquo;</a> System 3 - Amiga 81% Spectrum 85% C&amp;VG Hit “On the Spectrum at least, Dominator is one of the best shoot ‘em ups aroundm probably the best I’ve seen since R-Type. The Amiga version is up against stiffer competition, but it holds its own with the likes of Menace and Denaris.“</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3012">&ldquo;3D Pool&rdquo;</a> Firebird - C64 80% “3D Pool is innovative, unusual and very, very playable. If you don’t mind the waits between goes (you could always play it with another human player), it’s a definite ‘must buy’.“</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004271">&ldquo;Run the Gauntlet&rdquo;</a> Ocean - Spectrum 83% Amiga 82% “Ocean have certainly done a great job bringing Run the Gauntlet to our screens, and any sports sim fan after an action-packed game should definitely look this up.“ (“Run the Gaunlet” was TV sports competition show)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3521">&ldquo;Typhoon Thompson&rdquo;</a> Broderbund/Domark - ST/Amiga 89% C&amp;VG Hit “Typhoon Thomspon isn’t a complex game to play, and there are only four missions, but it’s adequate entertainment because those graphics make it such fun that you keep coming back for more.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1274">&ldquo;King’s Quest IV&rdquo;</a> Sierra Online - ST/Amiga/PC 91% &ldquo;When King’s Quest I first appeared, the novelty of its animation system was one of its main attractions. Sierra has not stood still since then, and, whilst continuing the same background theme in subsequent King’s Quests, it has steadily improved its techniques and tricks, to produce this, King’s Quest IV, which I rank as its finest game to date.“</li>
