<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>While there was still no news on the fate of Commodore, the UK office was busy
preparing for the World of Commodore show, which was to take place at the
Wembley Exhibition Centre, December 9th through 11th. It was to be a “buying
show” where the primary goal was for attendees to do a bit of shopping, but
The One wondered if there’d be any Commodore kit left to purchase by then.</p>
<p>Anco’s next footie game would be &ldquo;Fantasy Football Manager”, tho it seems like
it was never released.</p>
<p>Retailer Silica released a new CD32 pack called “Critical Zone” with seven
games bundled for £249.</p>
<p>There had been excitement at The One’s office upon receiving a review copy of
<a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">&ldquo;Sensible World of Soccer”</a>, however they decided to hold off on
publishing for a month as there were still a few features missing.</p>
<p>Vulcan Software were moving at quite a clip with the development of their
Valhalla series. It took them a mere five months to finish <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1116">&ldquo;Valhalla: Before
the War”</a> which was due out in January.</p>
<p>Supermarkets would now be stocking the latest PD wares thanks to Wholesale
Public Domain. They apparently handled distributing games from US devs like
Apogee, id and Epic Mega Games.</p>
<p>SSI had been acquired by Mindscape for a cool £11.5 million. During the same
week they also bought French developer Atreid Concept.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CentreGold (US Gold’s parent company) had snapped up Core Design
for “over £5 million”.</p>
<p>The UK government’s Monopolies and Mergers Commission had been asked to look
into the way games were made and sold due to complaints it had received from
parents, customers and retailers. It was unclear when the verdict would be
announced, but it was expected to be a “not guilty”.</p>
<p>21st Century had just released the eagerly anticipated <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1452">&ldquo;Pinball
Illusions”</a>, the third entry in the series.</p>
<p>The One had their hopes up that Cryo would be bringing &ldquo;Commander Blood&rdquo; (a
sequel to the baffling <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=228">&ldquo;Captain Blood”</a>) to the Amiga (they didn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>The next submarine sim from Microprose was to be <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1814">&ldquo;Sub War 2050”</a>.</p>
<p>Krisalis reckoned they had a Zelda competitor in development in the form of
<a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1767">&ldquo;Legend”</a>. Hmm, not sure about that.</p>
<p>Production of Data Design’s <a href="https://hol.abime.net/5411">&ldquo;Zonked!&rdquo;</a> (which had been reviewed last issue) had stalled due to - and it seems this was serious - the game&rsquo;s two programmers both breaking their arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frontier: First Encounters&rdquo; had also been delayed, but for unknown reasons.
It would not make it to the Amiga.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what this story means, but Nazrac “The Eliminator” was
sponsoring a “Galactic tour” around the US and London to find the champion of
Time Warner’s new arcade machine, “T-MEK”.</p>
<p>Sensi Soft’s Jon Hare accused Kompart of producing a Sensi Soccer “lookalike”
with its <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2403">&ldquo;Football Glory”</a>. He did have a point there.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month’s two demo disks:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=762">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat II&rdquo;</a> Acclaim (demo)</li>
</ul>
<p>An interview with programmer John Twiddy.</p>
<p>Getting the in-depth Work in Progress this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1182">&ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo;</a> Virgin</li>
<li><a href="https://hol.abime.net/4474">&ldquo;Mighty Max&rdquo;</a> WJS Designs/Ocean (unreleased)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=762">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat II&rdquo;</a> Probe/Acclaim</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=938">&ldquo;Sensible Golf&rdquo;</a> Sensible Software/Virgin</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=216">&ldquo;Cannon Fodder 2&rdquo;</a> Sensible Software/Virgin - 85% “There’s no arguing that the Cannon Fodder concept is a brilliant one, but as far as reviewing it as a sequel goes, I must say that I’m a bit disappointed.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1180">&ldquo;Jungle Strike&rdquo;</a> Hyperial/Ocean - 86% “Somehow the game doesn’t seem quite as threatening as Desert Strike, maybe because of the Gulf ‘thang’, and essentially for Desert vets it’s more of the same.“</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1460">&ldquo;Premier Manager 3”</a> Realms of Fantasy/Gremlin - 87% “It has to be said that Premier Manager 3 is the best the series will ever get. But I think Gremlin has added just as many bells and whistles to an otherwise plain game as it possibly can.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3327">&ldquo;PGA Euro Tour&rdquo;</a> The Dome/Ocean - 88% “Golf games stand or fall by their control method and PGA scores a hole-in-one. ‘Pars’ and ‘birdies’ are gettable, but consistency is a bit of a bugger to achieve and this, they tell me, is what makes golf an addictive game.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1165">&ldquo;Zeewolf&rdquo;</a> Binary Asylum - 80% “Game play-wise, Zeewolf is quite satisfying, with a ‘Desert Strike meets Apocalypse’ feeling, as you blow up buildings and rescue hapless folk.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1793">&ldquo;Super Stardust&rdquo;</a> Team 17 - 90% “… everything is exactly how it should be - traditional, uncomplicated gameplay wrapped up in eye-popping graphics. Most changes are purely cosmetic.”</li>
