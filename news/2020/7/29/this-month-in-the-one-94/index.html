<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>The fate of Commodore UK was close to becoming a bit clearer with an
announcement regarding a new owner was due &ldquo;any day now&rdquo;. The &ldquo;most solid&rdquo;
information pointed to a &ldquo;Far-Eastern&rdquo; company, with Acer, Samsung and
Goldstar all rumoured to be in the running. While the UK office had continued
trading, they weren&rsquo;t receiving any new units to sell which meant they had to
make do with whatever stock they had in their warehouses. The One was putting
on a brave face: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty unthinkable that a company which can sell
150,000 machines at £299 each in a year (the Amiga 1200, in other words) will
be simply wiped out. Expect good news soon.&rdquo; Hmm yeah.</p>
<p>The One took a look at just how Commodore found itself in this grim situation.</p>
<p>Glasgow based Amiga user group 24-bit Club were holding a competition for art
created on the Amiga, with prizes totalling £5,000 to be won.</p>
<p>Amiga distributor Silica had slashed the price of a A4000 030 with 214mb hard
drive by £200 (down to £999). The 540mb model would set you back £1299.</p>
<p>NewTek was to sell &ldquo;Lightwave&rdquo; by itself for the first time (rather than
bundled with their Video Toaster). The expected cost was to be around £600.</p>
<p>BSkyB&rsquo;s videogame show &ldquo;Head to Head&rdquo; (hosted by Violet Berlin) was to get a
&ldquo;3D version&rdquo; requiring 3D glasses.</p>
<p>The Golden Joysticks were held, with Virgin taking &ldquo;Best Software House&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">&ldquo;Cannon Fodder&rdquo;</a> &ldquo;Best Original Computer Game&rdquo;, Sensible Software &ldquo;Best
Computer Programmer&rdquo; and <a href="http://hol.abime.net/1367">&ldquo;TFX&rdquo;</a> &ldquo;Best Computer Simulation&rdquo;. Acclaim
also picked up an award for &ldquo;services to the industry&rdquo;. The night was hosted
by &ldquo;zany, madcap Radio 1 DJ, Steve Wright&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Somewhat bizarrely, Oxford based Data Business were producing what looked like
erotic mouse pads.</p>
<p>Game industry trade body ELSPA were considering relaxing their rules on
covermounted games. Giving away whole (commercial) games was a no-no, but
opinions were starting to shift with regards to older back catalogue titles.
I&rsquo;m curious as to when the original rules came into place since mags went to
town with that kind of thing in the late 80s.</p>
<p>Despite the Commodore drama, Amiga software sales continued to be strong. They
accounted for 21% of all games sold in the UK, slightly less than the Mega
Drive, but double that of SNES and PC. It was a 1.5% rise on the previous
month. CD32 crept up to 2.5% and was still fair ahead of the other CD
platforms.</p>
<p>Team 17 were staying loyal to the Amiga with a whopping 12 CD32 games in
development. Their recently released <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1538">&ldquo;Arcade Pool&rdquo;</a> raced to #1 in the
charts, and they rejected thoughts of licensing console conversions out
(doesn&rsquo;t mean they wouldn&rsquo;t do them in house, of course).</p>
<p>Sensible Software and Renegade were about to release <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=940">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer
International Edition&rdquo;</a> which was all up to date for the World Cup and
would sport a few new features such as yellow and red cards.</p>
<p>Gepro claimed their glasses would provide 99% protection against
&ldquo;electromagnetic radiation&rdquo; which reducing eyestrain and combatting
drowsiness. Hmm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Euroscene 1&rdquo; was a CD compilation from Almathera featuring &ldquo;game sequences,
art, music and graphics demos by the 10,000 Amiga programmers who contribute
to the Amiga demo scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IBM had developed a new CD format which would be able to store “12 hours of
music or several movies”. They had figured out a way to effectively stack
multiple layers onto a single disc. The downside being that existing CD
players would not be able to read them&hellip;</p>
<p>Virgin opened 6 new Megastores. The One was supportive of the move given that
they’d be carrying Amigas as well as those pesky consoles which other chains
had started to sell exclusively.</p>
<p>Interplay V1.0 from Optonica was a CDrrom authoring system for Amigas.</p>

<p>The One’s interpretation of the history of the Amiga in a series of comic pane
style photos.</p>

<p>A collection of “fan-tastic” Amiga related facts which may or may not have
been mainly bollocks.</p>
<p>Gary Penn provided a rundown of his essential Amiga games and had a good rant
about how quality games were coming to an end on the machine as developers
flocked to more lucrative platforms.</p>

<p>The Sensible World of Soccer dev diary reached its fifth instalment, which
began with journo Matt Broughton getting somewhat desperate over not having
anything to write about. Thankfully he finally got Jon Hare on the phone who
talked in great detail about their recent work on the transfer market and the
complexities of calculating a player’s form.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2516">“Out to Lunch”</a> Mindscape - 90% “I like it. A lot, in fact - Mindscape has come up with one of the simplest and most addictive platformers for ages. I could rattle out the age-old cliches like ‘it takes a minute to learn but a life-time to master’ or ‘simply brilliant and brilliantly simple’ (or something like that), but I won’t. Because I just have.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1796">“Quik”</a> Titus - 80% “At best Quik is a very fast (quick?) platformer, with sparsely-populated levels and loads of open space to gambol in, but it loses points because the action stays the same despite a number of different graphical changes.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=225">“Banshee”</a> Core Design - 89% “The game’s a great roller-coaster ride to hell, and it takes every ounce of concentration to keep the cool-hand and clear head even for the most hardened game player.”</li>
