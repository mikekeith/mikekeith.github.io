<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Late breaking news was that Maxis were porting <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1188">&ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo;</a> to the
Amiga. The PC original was impressive, but would it survive the translation?</p>
<p>It looked like <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=934">&ldquo;The Second Samurai&rdquo;</a> would be Vivid Image Design&rsquo;s last
title for a little while as they were going all in on CD gaming. Mev Dinc and
his team were taking the interesting approach of insisting that all design and
illustration work be finished before a single line of code was written.. hmm.</p>
<p>The much delayed rather gorgeous isometric action adventure <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=306">&ldquo;Darkmere&rdquo;</a>
was about to arrive. Core&rsquo;s Jeremy Smith explained the lengthy development as
being the result of a single programmer who managed to get 40% of the code
done before realising the design was too ambitious. That resulted in a re-
shuffle and the new team re-writing it from scratch.</p>
<p>A row was brewing between software houses and distributors. CDs were cheaper
to produce when meant narrowing the margin the distributors received, so they
reacted by refusing to take them.</p>
<p>ELPSA (European Leisure Software Publisher&rsquo;s Association) was looking to
introduce a standardised age ratings scheme. They were hoping for it to come
into effect from 1st of May, and were keen to get it established before the
government stepped in with its own scheme.</p>
<p>There was rather grim news from Commodore&rsquo;s US parent company which had posted
a massive $365.5 million loss in the year ending June 1993. Would there be
implications for Commodore UK?</p>
<p>Software house The Sales Curve were rebranding as SCI.</p>
<p>Game stores were popping up everywhere, it seemed. HMV had opened 40 during
1993 (they had 10 to start with) and Game were looking to add another 30
(bringing their total up to almost 60). Likewise, northern chain Next Level
planned to take its current 5 stores up to 50.</p>
<p>There was an apology for last month&rsquo;s Next Month page which, they said, was
meant as a light hearted jest, but apparently caused some offence.</p>
<p>The upcoming film featuring Wesley Snipes as Marvel&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Shadow&rdquo; was tipped
to be the big blockbuster of the summer.. so naturally The One wondered which
publisher would snap up the game rights.</p>
<p>The Tolt d&rsquo;Or awards were held in Paris, with Team 17 winning &ldquo;Best Action
Game&rdquo; for <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed II&rdquo;</a> and Ocean&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=767">&ldquo;Mr Nutz&rdquo;</a> picking up
&ldquo;Best Platform Game&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A rather low turnout of 35,828 people for the Future Entertainment Show held
at London&rsquo;s Olympia meant plans for any further shows were at risk.</p>
<p>Virgin dropped the price of Dino Dini&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1408">&ldquo;Goal!&rdquo;</a> by 5 quid to £19.99.</p>
<p>In a rather amusing turn of events.. Liverpool based drug education body
Healthwise released <a href="http://hol.abime.net/5545">&ldquo;Wrecked&rdquo;</a> to try to educate kids about the dangers
of drugs. The local rags picked up the story, and it soon made it to national
TV and Radio&hellip; except people (including MPs) were outraged because they
thought it was <em>promoting</em> drug use.</p>
<p>A month or two earlier HMV&rsquo;s Level One in London played host to a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1175">&ldquo;Brutal
Sports Football&rdquo;</a> competition and The One had a report of the day.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month&rsquo;s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/2689">&ldquo;Galactic&rdquo;</a> Stavros Fasoulas</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1169">&ldquo;Zool 2&rdquo;</a> Gremlin</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3667">&ldquo;Beetle&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The One chatted to Tony Crowther, Ross Goodley and Tony Lazzerini - the team
behind the CD32 game <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=754">&ldquo;Liberation&rdquo;</a> - about their experiences with
Commodore&rsquo;s latest bit of kit.</p>
<p>Getting the Work In Progress treatment this month were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1757">&ldquo;Heimdall 2&rdquo;</a> Core Design</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1098">&ldquo;Universe&rdquo;</a> Core Design</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=301">&ldquo;Cool Spot&rdquo;</a> Jaguar Software Consultants/Virgin Interactive</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2806">&ldquo;Dennis and Gnasher&rdquo;</a> Absolute Image/Alternative</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also 6 pages of mini (one paragraph) previews of a load of games
that were expected to hit the Amiga in &lsquo;94. Rather interestingly it include
screen shots of Bullfrog&rsquo;s &ldquo;Magic Carpet&rdquo;, &ldquo;Creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Theme Park&rdquo; (the
last one did get a release on the Amiga).</p>
<p>PD games reviewed this month were:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Klawz&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3667">&ldquo;Beetle&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2094">&ldquo;Ice Runner&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3794">&ldquo;Particle Man&rdquo;</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Intense&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>The One interviewed Commodore UK&rsquo;s Managing Director, David Pleasance, to find
out just wtf was going on. David reported better than expected sales for the
A1200 (160,000 in the 6 months to Christmas), and felt they were on track for
110,000 CD32s (expected to be 4x the number of Mega CDs sold). As always,
David pulled no punches, referring to the &ldquo;A500/A500+/A600 farce&rdquo; which they
were still trying to shake off. He insisted there would be no new computer
between the A1200 and A4000 (there had been rumours of an A1400) to try
prevent potential customers holding out for the next model. Interestingly he
said they were already working on the next two generations of the CD32.</p>
<p>To round off the year, the magazine&rsquo;s staff came up with their own top games
of &lsquo;93.</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2450">&ldquo;Robinson&rsquo;s Requiem&rdquo;</a> Daze</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/135">&ldquo;Dark Blade&rdquo;</a> D.E.X.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2538">&ldquo;Naughty Ones&rdquo;</a> Kompart</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sherlock Ness and the Dinosaur Detective Agency&rdquo; Alternative (unreleased?)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=763">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat&rdquo;</a> Probe/Virgin - 89% &ldquo;Mortal Kombat is, in my opnion, the best beat-&rsquo;em-up money can buy on the Amiga. It scrapes ahead of Body Blows for playability and amount of characters and moves, and knocks Streetfighter II into a cocked hat. The Probe Dream Factory has done it again - hurrah!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=593">&ldquo;Jetstrike&rdquo;</a> Shadow Software/Rasputin - 84% &ldquo;No! Wait! Don&rsquo;t turn the page over! Within this humble-looking game there lurks an excellent lump of fun just waiting to be stroked gently.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=447">&ldquo;Genesia&rdquo;</a> Microids/Mindscape - 88% &ldquo;Genesia has so many aspects I doubt if the programmers would be able to sum it all up in a sixteen page review - but that&rsquo;s where much of the game&rsquo;s appeal lies.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1169">&ldquo;Zool 2&rdquo;</a> Gremlin - 90% &ldquo;I was expecting to be very underwhelmed by this, but I&rsquo;ve actually had a brilliant time reviewing it and have already got a personal copy waiting to be taken home. Many games have tried to copy console fun, but this is about as good as it gets.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1046">&ldquo;T2: The Arcade Game&rdquo;</a> Probe/Virgin - 84% &ldquo;Have those Probe boys been on extra-special programming pills or what this month? First, they knock out a cracking conversion of Mortal Kombat, then they go and give us a really very good version of the T2 coin-op!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=655">&ldquo;Lamborghini American Challenge&rdquo;</a> Titus - 83% &ldquo;The speed of the racing is impressive and the graphics and sound do their job very well but a few different cars wouldn&rsquo;t have gone down badly.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1604">&ldquo;Microcosm&rdquo;</a> Psygnosis - 86% &ldquo;Well, as you can tell, I&rsquo;ve been completely blown away. Anyone who moans that CDs don&rsquo;t offer much in the way of new technology should get their leering gear around this.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3122">&ldquo;Skidmarks&rdquo;</a> Acid Software - 88% &ldquo;Like Sensisoccer, this is a timeless two-player game which is likely to be dragged out of your collection time and again, but it&rsquo;s worth bering in mind that single players may find the appeal wearing off after a while.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=429">&ldquo;Fury of the Furries&rdquo;</a> Kalisto/Mindscape - 90% &ldquo;What can I say? This is just brilliant! I hate to draw comparisons with other games when you have a stunning game like this, but take Lemmings and mix it up with Lost Vikings and you&rsquo;re kinda there.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=197">&ldquo;Bubba &lsquo;N&rsquo; Stix&rdquo;</a> Core - 91% &ldquo;Bubba is a truly fab game that could have done with being longer. What&rsquo;s there is going to keep you busy for quite a while and you&rsquo;re more than likely to enjoy yourself while you play. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s the computer equivalent of sex - superb while it&rsquo;s happening but over before you know it. Or so I&rsquo;m led to believe.&rdquo;</li>
