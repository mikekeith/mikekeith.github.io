            <p>When I made the decision to join Magic Leap back at the start of 2013, I told
my friends that I had no idea where it was going to lead, but I knew it would
be a ride&hellip; and that it was.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two weeks to the day that myself, my team here in NZ and over 1,000 of my
workmates at offices across the world were laid off. Well, technically those
of us in NZ entered into a &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; period of a few days as mandated by
NZ law, but that ended on Monday with all of us being made redundant. It was a
sad end to what had been an intense (in good and bad ways) but incredible 7.5
years for me.</p>

<p>I was - to my knowledge - the first games industry person to join the company
when the headcount was 20-ish. While my primary focus was on creating Mixed
Reality games/experiences, I was very fortunate to get to work closely with
people on teams throughout the company from all manner of fields, software and
hardware. Headpose, world reconstruction, hand tracking, eye tracking, 6dof
totems, object recognition, optics, audio algorithms, OS, SDK, deep learning..
the list goes on. I even maintained our prototype devices, manually re-
calibrating and performing occasional surgery on them. It was all absolutely
fascinating.</p>
<p>My team were always the first to take bleeding edge in-development platform
features and integrate them into our experiences to help iron out issues and
guide the API design. We worked with pretty much every device revision, from
bare boards through to final wearables. While this was a challenging endeavour
it was hugely beneficial to the platform and the company as whole.</p>

<p>As for the games we created, we knew right from the very start that Mixed
Reality was going to provide some significant new challenges. The primary one
being that every user/player will have a unique experience since we merge
virtual content with the real world. The implications of this are huge and
impacts everything from AI and navigation, through to UX (where to place
interactive objects and what does that interaction even look like), physics,
sound design and more. All of our systems had to be designed with these
challenges in mind. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=T38WX1RKnOE">&ldquo;Invaders&rdquo; pushed the platform further than any other
experience.</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more I could ramble on about - it was 7.5 years spent working
with some of the smartest, most talented people on the planet. I learned so
much and am immensely proud of what we achieved. I really hope the things we
were working on see the light of day - they were awesome and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=y4VTxpDNeWk">very, very
fun</a>.</p>
<p>Make no bones about it, AR/MR is going to be huge - it will change everything.
And there are suddenly a lot of brilliant people on the job market now who&rsquo;ve
been working on &amp; living with this future tech and its implications for
years&hellip; just sayin'.</p>
