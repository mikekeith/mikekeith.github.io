<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Andy Nuttall (aka “Nutts”) joined the mag as Deputy Editor after having done
five months hard time at ST Format.</p>
<p>Third time’s the charm - or so Commodore hoped with its third CD32 bundle
since launch. The Voyage pack included <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1604">“Microcosm”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=571">“The Chaos
Engine”</a>, plus four games from the two existing bundles while stocks
lasted, all for £299.99.</p>
<p>Codemasters were bringing <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=229">“Captain Dynamo”</a> and the <a href="http://hol.abime.net/370">“Dizzy CD
Collection”</a> to the CD32. The latter would contain ten games on one CD
and cost £21.99. They were contemplating of also releasing <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=743">“Micro
Machines”</a> and more on the console if sales were up to scratch.</p>
<p>ESP reckoned their “Oracle Racing System” software could predict winning race
horses when the latest details were fed into its database. It was available
via mail order for a cool £99.95</p>
<p>“Lemmings for Breakfast” was a promotional campaign by Boots, WH Smith,
Psygnosis and The Big Breakfast TV show which would see the high street stores
slashing the prices of the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=676">“Lemmings”</a> releases.</p>
<p>A monitor shortage that had plagued Commodore after Philips pulled out of the
Amiga monitor shortage just before Christmas looked to be at an end with ZCL
supplying the Microvitec Pro Graphics Multi Sync. Stocks of 1084s looked to
have been replenished as well.</p>
<p>It seemed last month’s review of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=652">“Bubble ‘n’ Squeak”</a> featured the
wrong verdict panel, so The One provided the correct one. (Final score of 87%)</p>
<p>Virgin acquired a 25% stake in point and click specialist Revolution Software
in order to take on LucasArts and Sierra On-Line.</p>
<p>The success of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1604">“Microcosm”</a> seemed to take Psygnosis a little by
surprise as stocks ran out. Not only was it the number on CD32 title, but by
mid March the CD32 had already captured 44% of CD software sales.</p>
<p>As reported last month, Domark’s distribution manager Russell Ferrier was
working with Middlesex University to establish a game design degree.
Interestingly, applicants would be financed by software houses.</p>
<p>Audiogenic got the rights to use the Wembley (as in, the stadium) name and
were planning to release <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1803">“Wembley Rugby League”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1804">“Wembley
International Soccer”</a>.</p>
<p>Experts were skeptical of the hype over the “information superhighway” and
predicted that it’d be quite some time before consumers would be shopping,
banking, watching TV, downloading games and so on over “a single cable into
the living room”. Apparently 77% of people had never used a fax, and 66%
hadn’t used a PC. That latter stat seems quite remarkable.</p>
<p>There was a story about how Tony Cooper met his fiancé Janette in Portsmouth
after he repaired her printer&hellip; They were both Amiga fans which, I guess, is
why it made the news page.</p>
<p>Vulcan claimed their new game, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1103">“Valhalla and the Lord of the
Infinity”</a>, was the “first ever speech adventure” as it featured a
vocabulary of over 1,000 words. It would come on at least five disks but they
promised no disk swapping during levels.</p>
<p>Castle Communications were bullish about the potential for Video CDs and
announced three titles for release this month: “Pavarotti Nessus Dorma”, “The
History of Aviation” and “Dinosaurs Myth and Reality”.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Three disks graced this month’s cover featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=767">“Mr Nutz”</a> Ocean (demo)</li>
<li>“Ouch” PD</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1554">“Clockwiser”</a> Rasputin (demo)</li>

<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/3699">“Waggle O Mania 2”</a> Team 17</li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Broughton spent a day out filming with the crew and presenters of BBC2’s
new computer show, “The Net”. Each episode would include a segment called “Net
Attack” which focused on games and was produced by Dan Clapson who, it turned
out, had coded the Amiga and ST ports of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=258">“Chip’s Challenge”</a> amongst
others.</p>
<p>A snarky feature giving readers a peak at what would happen if the mag printed
reader reviews. Basically all scores were 100% and the summaries barely
coherent.</p>
<p>An interview with Arcane Software Developments who had produced the
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1119">“Powermonger”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=854">“Populous 2”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=163">“Birds of Prey”</a> intros
before moving onto <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=306">“Darkmere”</a> and the upcoming <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1597">“Turbo Trax”</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>Andy Nuttall paid the Sensi lads a visit in what was part 3 of The One’s
series of interviews with them. The main topics discussed were the soon-to-be-
released <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=940">“Sensible Soccer v1.2 - International Edition”</a> and the highly
anticipated “proper” follow up, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">“Sensible World of Soccer”</a>.<img src="Image%2026-05-2020,%2020-35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>PD Zone titled covered in this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4116">“Smidge”</a> 90%</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4683">“Karate Master”</a> 80%</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5205">“Task Force”</a> 69%</li>
<li>“Splodge” 69%</li>
<li>“Xmas Time” 68%</li>
<li>“Punters” 87%</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5414">“Digger”</a> 85%</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue closed with a rather entertaining “Next Month” page, done in the
style of TV listings. Someone definitely had fun with this one.</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=374">“Empire Football”</a> Empire</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1821">“Tactical Manager”</a> Black Legend</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1733">“D-Day The Beginning of the End”</a> Impressiions</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3272">“Lords of the Realm”</a> Impressions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=625">“K240”</a> Gremlin - 90% “Not since Dune 2 have we been treated to such a great strategy game, designed in the mould of Populous but taking the whole idea beyond the stars and, er, into asteroids.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=90">“Armour-Geddon II”</a> Psygnosis - 86% “So, if you like to pick up a game and play it immediately, leave Armour-Geddon II well alone. The manual, for example, takes a good half-hour to read, while the game itself needs much longer to get to grips with.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1538">“Arcade Pool”</a> Team 17 - 82% “Obviously there’s no way that Team 17’s top-down simulation could ever beat the technical standards set by the follow-up to Jimmy White’s Whirlwind Snooker, but I reckon there’s room for more than one decent pool simulation and if you feel the same way this could be right up your street.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1275">“Kings Quest VI”</a> Revolution/Sierra OnLine - 84% “Though KOVI is not quite up to the standard of Simon The Sorceror (American spelling, not mine) or Beneath a Steel Sky, it certainly has as much to offer as far as depth and problem solving goes.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1606">“Ultimate Body Blows”</a> Team 17 - 81% “Another plus is that the CD32 controllers make individual moves and special moves easier to carry out, and you also get the feeling that the designers were more comfortable with the extra buttons. So that means this is a better system to run Body Blows on.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=75">“Apocalypse”</a> Miracle Games/Virgin - 81% “Although Apocalypse does its best to put you off from the start with what appear to be unfairly-tough enemy attack patterns, with perseverance it’s apparent that everything happens for a reason.”</li>
