<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>While Commodore was still without a buyer, word leaked that the company
leading the pack was in fact Samsung who were looking to gain more of a
foothold in the European market. It seemed everything was hanging on that
deal.</p>
<p>Dominik Diamond was rumoured to be returning to &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A report from Mintel showed that the UK games industry contracted by 4% last
year. The market value in 1993 was £670 million compared to £700 million in
1992. One theory was falling software prices.</p>
<p>Music giant BMG announced they were making a move into games.</p>
<p>Team 17 had a busy few months ahead with planned releases of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1793">&ldquo;Super
Stardust&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809">&ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=58">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2: Tower Assault&rdquo;</a>,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=62">&ldquo;All Terrain Racing&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://hol.abime.net/4419">&ldquo;King of Thieves&rdquo;</a>. The latter was
particularly interesting as it was being developed by Rico Holmes and Andreas
Tadic of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=55">&ldquo;Alien Breed&rdquo;</a> fame, though it never saw a release.</p>
<p>Commodore&rsquo;s schedule for the months leading up to Christmas showed they hoped
to have 423 titles out for the CD32, almost double from what it was at this
point (197). While that sounds impressive, it was largely made up of CD-i
video discs and old CDTV &ldquo;gardening hits and karaoke&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Blockbuster coughed up £135 million to buy out Virgin Interactive
Entertainment.</p>
<p>The biggest consumer entertainment show in the UK, Live &lsquo;94, was to take place
at Earls Court from September 20th to 25th. Around 200,000 visitors were
expected.</p>
<p>Game industry body ELPSA launched three raids on pirates to recover 500 CDs of
software in a haul apparently valued at £10 million.</p>
<p>It hadn&rsquo;t been long since the release of &ldquo;Frontier&rdquo;, but <a href="http://hol.abime.net/5675">&ldquo;The First
Encounter&rdquo;</a> - standalone followup - was due for release in October and
promised a number of significant improvements (particularly &ldquo;less bugs&rdquo;).
While it was released for PC, it wouldn&rsquo;t end up gracing the Amiga.</p>
<p>Distributor ZCL announced a series of peripherals. There was a CD drive for
the A1200 costing £199.99 and an adapter for the CD32 allowing the user to
connect a keyboard and floppy drive. They also had &ldquo;two new types of storage
card&rdquo; delivering between 20mb and 340mb capacity.</p>
<p>Despite losing deals with LucasArts, SSI and Novalogic, US Gold were bullish
about their prospects as they opened a new development office in Oxford called
Silicon Dreams. Apparently LucasArts games had only made up 3% of their total
sales.</p>
<p>Software house Zeppelin was snapped up by US publisher Merit Software for a
£2.2 million.</p>
<p>After months of speculation, 20th Century Fox opened a games division which
would release its first title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pagemaster#Video_game">&ldquo;Pagemaster&rdquo;</a> in November (which would be
developed by Probe). Seems it only made it out on PC and handhelds.</p>
<p>UK high street retailer Currys was set to close 80 town centre stores with 20
more likely to follow as the economic downtown took hold. Boots had also
reported game sales had dropped by a third during the first quarter of the
year.</p>
<p>Sales chart company Gallup were to increase the number of retailers
contributing to the numbers to 3250, up from 2000.</p>
<p>Microvalue&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3020">&ldquo;Soccer Superstars&rdquo;</a> would feature the logo of sports
company Mitre in a licensing deal.</p>

<p>An interview with Paul Carrington and Lisa Tunnah who had formed Vulcan
Software and recently released their first game, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1103">&ldquo;Valhalla&rdquo;</a>, after a
mere 5 months of development time.</p>
<p>The One called out software publishers and developers for talking guff about
how great their upcoming games were going to be (which then turned out to be
naff), in an article titled &ldquo;Liars!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Andrew Braybrook highlighted some games which he reckoned had pushed the
Amiga&rsquo;s technical capabilities. They were:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=920">&ldquo;Ruff &lsquo;N&rsquo; Tumble&rdquo;</a> Wunderkind/Renegade - 91% &ldquo;Everything about it hangs together brilliantly; the graphic style is perfect, the gameplay finely-tuned, and the pumping soundtrack requires two huge speakers and sympathetic neighbours to show it at its best. Yes, I know it&rsquo;s a bit embarrassing, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re aware of how much I like to moan, but Ruff &rsquo;n&rsquo; Tumble really is the apex of platform pleasure.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2611">&ldquo;Wild Cup Soccer&rdquo;</a> Teque/Millennium - 81% &ldquo;I enjoyed Wild Cup Soccer - in two-player mode, anyway. Charging around, mashing the opposition in a variety of satisfyingly gory and violent ways, is a right hoot and no mistaking.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1990">&ldquo;Vital Light&rdquo;</a> Efecto Caos/Millennium - 81% &ldquo;&hellip; the early levels are tediously easy and the whole thing smacks of a poor man&rsquo;s Tetris. Dig a bit deeper, though, and you discover that the game - despite its aesthetics - is a shoot-&rsquo;em-up at heart, but one which requires as much forward planning as Tetris, Klax and their ilk.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3165">&ldquo;Putty Squad&rdquo;</a> System 3 - 90% &ldquo;All of the things that let Putty down first time round have been improved a thousand times over, with major gameplay improvements, excellent level layouts, and some really good toys to get your teeth into.&rdquo; (this didn&rsquo;t see a release until 2013)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=634">&ldquo;Kid Chaos&rdquo;</a> Magnetic Fields/Ocean - 87% &ldquo;What we have is a lightning-fast platformer, running easily as quickly as Sonic on the Mega Drive, and there&rsquo;s even an impressive number of enemies in there too. Add to that the most layers of parallax scrolling that we&rsquo;ve seen since Lionheart, a thumping soundtrack and a range of spot-on sound effect, and you&rsquo;re looking at a very impressive game.&rdquo;</li>
