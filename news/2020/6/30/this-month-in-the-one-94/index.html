<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>News broke as the mag went to press that Commodore worldwide had basically
filed for administration in the Bahamas, where the company was registered.
Just what this meant was unclear, but things did not look good. It wasn&rsquo;t
terribly surprising considering the losses the company had posted over the
last couple of years, though Commodore UK had performed well. While this move
was obviously concerning, The One were confident that the continued popularity
of the Amiga would mean a positive outcome one way or another.</p>
<p>The winners of the ECTS awards were announced with &ldquo;Doom&rdquo; dominating, picking
up &ldquo;Computer Game of the Year&rdquo; and &ldquo;Overall Game of the Year&rdquo;. Viewers of BBC
kids TV show &ldquo;Alive and Kicking&rdquo; chose <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1782">&ldquo;Frontier&rdquo;</a> for their award,
&ldquo;Rebel Assault&rdquo; won &ldquo;Best CD Game&rdquo; and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1031">&ldquo;Syndicate&rdquo;</a> &ldquo;Most Original
Game&rdquo;. Perhaps the most galling win as far as Amiga fans were concerned was
that of the Atari Jaguar over the CD32 for &ldquo;Best Hardware&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mersyside-base Spectacular Graphics had produced a coin-op cabinet for the
arcades that could house a CD32.</p>
<p>BT joined the games industry&rsquo;s governing body ELPSA as they continued their
push towards delivering games and movies over their network. While it was
clear this would be some way off for the customers, they were pumping billions
of pounds into their efforts and had setup an experiment with 70 employees in
Ipswich. Oracle were providing their &ldquo;Massively Parallel Processing&rdquo; tech
which would allow BT to keep just one digitised copy of game while serving
thousands of players.</p>
<p>The CD32 continued to dominate CD software sales and several new titles were
announced: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=538">&ldquo;Rise of the Robots&rdquo;</a>, &ldquo;Cyberwar&rdquo; (not released?), <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=374">&ldquo;Empire
Soccer&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1188">&ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The World of Commodore show was making a comeback, slightly re-branded as
World of Amiga and would take place at Wembley in November.</p>
<p>The CD sales figures put the CD32 at a 55.6% market share, PC 24.2%, Mega CD
18.3% and CD-i 1.1%.</p>
<p>Team 17 were about to release <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=58">&ldquo;Alien Breed II: Tower Assault&rdquo;</a> on
floppy as well as a CD32 enhanced <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed II&rdquo;</a>. Other titles in
development were an arcade strategy game called &ldquo;King of Thieves&rdquo; and a
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=640">10-pin bowling game</a>.</p>
<p>The One were launching a club.. maybe? Or maybe it was just an excuse to
explain away typos as coded messages.</p>
<p>Another month, another new CD32 bundle from Commodore. The Spectacular Voyage
pack featured six games: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1604">&ldquo;Microcosm&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=571">&ldquo;The Chaos Engine&rdquo;</a>,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1355">&ldquo;Wing Commander&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1950">&ldquo;Dangerous Streets&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1367">&ldquo;Diggers&rdquo;</a> and
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1367">&ldquo;Oscar&rdquo;</a>. The price was £249.99.</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5568">&ldquo;P.I.D.&rdquo;</a> (Private Investigator Dollarlaly) was to be a racing game from Terramarque in the &ldquo;Spy Hunter&rdquo;/&ldquo;APB&rdquo; vein. It was unreleased.</p>
<p>Tucked away in a corner of Commodore&rsquo;s ECTS stand was a prototype CD drive for
the A1200 which caused a bit of a stir. However, there were no concrete plans
for selling it at that point in time. David Pleasance felt the lack of MPEG
video playback would reduce its appeal so they would need to find a compelling
price point.</p>
<p>Developer Stellar Genesis Agency were working on CD strategy game &ldquo;Space
Academy&rdquo; for Mindscape (unreleased?).</p>
<p>Speaking of Mindscape&hellip; they had just been bought by media giant Pearson for
a cool £310 million. Pearson owned the likes of Thames TV, the Financial Times
and Penguin Books.</p>
<p>POSH Marketing had developed a touchscreen for the CD32 which would find its
way into information access terminals like those found at airports.</p>
<p>The Computer Graphics Expo was to take place at Wembley in November.</p>
<p>New Tek&rsquo;s Video Toaster was finally going to get a UK release. It wouldn&rsquo;t
come cheap, mind you, as the software, A4000 and NTSC -&gt; PAL converter would
total around £12,000. There was also a brief mention of Commodore&rsquo;s latest
machine, the A4000 tower ( the &ldquo;most powerful Amiga ever&rdquo;) for £2999.99.</p>
<p>Dr Julia Rutkowska told the British Psychological Society that computer games
can increase sociability rather than the commonly perceived idea that they
resulted in loners.</p>
<p>It looked like Virgin Interactive Entertainment was being fought over by
PolyGram and Disney. VIE was about to be listed on the US stock exchange and
was part owned by Blockbuster Video&hellip; who PolyGram had a majority stake in.
Meanwhile the software house had a close relationship with Disney. At any
rate, between that and the share flotation it was expected that Virgin would
be getting a serious cash injection.</p>
<p>Computer store chain Silica (described as &ldquo;the Amiga&rsquo;s most loyal high street
supporter&rdquo;) were to open 20 new shops.</p>
<p>Pinball was to meet RPGs in <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1092">&ldquo;Ultimate Pinball Quest&rdquo;</a> from Infogrammes.</p>
<p>Peter Molyneux was to make an appearance at Level One in London to show off
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1053">&ldquo;Theme Park&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>A sequel to Sensible Software&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">&ldquo;Canon Fodder&rdquo;</a> was in the works, but
it was early days (one level set in the desert) and they hadn&rsquo;t decided on a
name but were determined it wouldn&rsquo;t be called <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=216">&ldquo;Cannon Fodder 2&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>A big report on all the Amiga related announcements and gossip at ECTS.</p>
<p>An interview with Tony Bickley, a senior producer at US Gold, discussing the
upcoming <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2692">&ldquo;World Cup &lsquo;94&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Getting the in depth Work in Progress treatment this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=920">&ldquo;Ruff ‘n’ Tumble&rdquo;</a> Renegade</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1418">&ldquo;Kick Off 3&rdquo;</a> Anco</li>

<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1103">&ldquo;Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity&rdquo;</a> Vulcan (a little odd this got a preview and a review in the same issue, but apparently the game was in development right up until the deadline)</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t actually realise this regular feature was a development diary of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">“Sensible World of Soccer”</a> until its fourth installment in this issue</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought it was a weirdly long drawn out series of interviews with Sensi.
At any rate, the main thing this month was they had implemented The Season
mode&hellip; that and Jon and Chris Chapman flew to LA to meet with Virgin and, er,
go to Disneyland.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this month’s PD Zone:</p>

<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1222">&ldquo;Embryo&rdquo;</a> Black Legend/Croteam</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3703">&ldquo;On the Ball&rdquo;</a> Ascon/Daze</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=364">“Elfmania”</a> Terramarque/Renegade - 91% “Elfmania makes all other beat ‘em-ups looks like out-dated crap and will hopefully prevent other software companies even dreaming about releasing complete rubbish like ‘Dangerous Streets’ on any format.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1103">“Valhalla: The Lord of Infinity”</a> Vulcan - 81% “The speech&hellip; well, it talks, which is impressive and innovative, but after a few hours the main character’s whiny voice gets annoying. He’s got a relatively huge vocabulary, but there’s only so many times you can hear him say ‘I’m scared,’ without wishing there was an option to listen to only the important points.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1713">“Bump ‘N’ Burn”</a> Grandslam - 90% “So here we have, in essence, Super MarioKart - and bloody good it is too! If you’re familiar with the SNES game I’ve mentioned, you’ll already be aware of the simple fun to be had from this sort of racing game, but you really have to play ‘Bump ‘N’ Burn’ to appreciate just how addictive it is, especially when the producers have got the CPU intelligence just right (which I’m glad to announce, Grandslam has done here).”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1821">“Tactical Manager”</a> Talking Birds/Kompart UK - 80% “Very seldom, though, did I find myself having fun, and that - call me picky - is how I judge a game. For me, TM is too realistic; there are just too many stats for each player, which you must read and digest if you want to succeed.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=149">“Benefactor”</a> Digital Illusions/Psygnosis - 85% “It’s got a strange appeal, perhaps even more so than Lemmings had - partly because the solutions to most of the early levels are entirely obvious, but they rely on some joystick trickery as well as a quick imagination to complete.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2761">“Sierra Soccer: World Challenge Edition”</a> Sierra - 83% “Unlike many recent releases, Sierra Soccer has managed to take all the good features from the best footy games around and re-present them in such a way that the game stands up in its own right.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1780">“James Pond 3: Operation Starfi5h”</a> Millennium - 90% “If I told you that Operation Starfi5h was quite unlike any other Amiga platform game, I wouldn’t be lying, it’s huge. No really, it’s very huge&hellip; and bloody fast.”</li>
</ul>
