<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Contrary to last month’s news, while ex-The One editor David Upchurch had been
assigned to a new mag, it was to EMAP’s latest launch, PC Games, and not a
reboot of Sinclair User&hellip; which made a little more sense.</p>
<p>Ocean struck a deal with Virgin to release twelve of its games on Hit Squad,
their budget label. The lineup included <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">“Cannon Fodder”</a>,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=354">“Dune”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=355">“Dune 2”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=616">“Jimmy White’s Whirlwind Snooker”</a>,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=82">“Archer Maclean’s Pool”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=889">“Realms”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=672">“Legend of
Kyrandia”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1026">“Supremacy”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=630">“KGB”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2030">“Reach for the
Skies”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2036">“Shuttle”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=705">“Lure of the Temptress”</a>. Ocean
expected to sell 200,000 copies between them.</p>
<p>Edge magazine won “Magazine of the Year” (who decided that was not specified).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=349">“Darkstone”</a> was to follow <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=306">“Darkmere”</a> from Core Design, though
apparently the two were not related&hellip; which is very odd as they share so many
similarities.</p>
<p>Seven titles had been crammed into Commodore’s latest A1200 bundle: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=207">“Brian
the Lion”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3630">“Total Carnage”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2514">“Zool 2”</a>, “Digita
Wordsworth 2.0”, “Digita Print Manager”, “Day by Day” and “Personal Paint
2.0”. Known as the “Computer Combat” pack, it would cost £349.99.</p>
<p>Dutch demo coders Team Hoi were to have their puzzler <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1554">“Clockwiser”</a>
published by Rasputin. The software house had also lined up <a href="http://hol.abime.net/5620">“Harold the Hairy
Hermit”</a> which was to feature “a totally unique sprite”. Hmm. It was not
released.</p>
<p>Daze Marketing were flogging copies of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=4128">“Ishar”</a> and
<a href="http://hol.abime.net/1496">“Transartica”</a> for £4.99 in order to drum up interest in the upcoming
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1762">“Ishar 3”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2450">“Robinson’s Requiem”</a>.</p>
<p>Commodore kicked off a new initiative called ACE (Amiga Centres of Excellence)
to highlight the ways the Amiga could help “pro” users.. The first location
had already opened in Wales.</p>
<p>It’s easy to look back on the CD32 as a failure (which it was), but sales had
been promising as it managed to capture 38.6% of the CD software market, ahead
of PC CD-Rom (31.3%), Mega CD (27.6%) and the CD-i (1.8%). There were a bunch
of big name releases on the way, not to mention the the hotly anticipated
Video CD module (delayed due to “technical hitches” at manufacturers and,
apparently, “nasty blizzards” at Commodore’s US HQ). Meanwhile the Jaguar and
3DO were difficult to find in shops&hellip; what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The father of Domark boss Dominic Wheatley had written a Victorian detective
book which had become the basis of a new who-dunnit for the CD32: <a href="http://hol.abime.net/697">“Herewith
the Clues”</a>.</p>
<p>The impending invasion of the games industry by Hollywood companies had been
feared for some time, and things got a little more real with MCA/Universal
buying a stake in Interplay.</p>
<p>News arrived that Team 17 had abandoned plans for <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1525">“Alien Breed 3D”</a> due
to the release of some game called “Doom”, which apparently was a “startling
shoot-em-up in the same vein”. The Alien Breed line would continue, though, in
the form of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=58">“Alien Breed: Tower Assault”</a>. (Maybe this was an April
Fool&rsquo;s?)</p>
<p>High street chains Our Price and Virgin Retail were to merge&hellip; except they
were already both owned by WH Smith, so this seemed to be more a ploy to boost
Our Price&rsquo;s offerings using Virgin&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.abime.net/2239">“Switchquiz”</a> was a new pub quiz style game from Switchsoft with the
unique selling point that it came with two or four handheld modules which
plugged into the parallel port. Think “Buzz!” for the PS3, but ten years
earlier.</p>
<p>The One recommended readers check out a fanzine called “Computer and Console
Guide” by Nathan White.</p>
<p>There was a snarky note about Impact Magazines shuttering “Amiga Force” (or,
“Amiga Farce”, as they referred to it).</p>
<p>Team 17 were looking to provide proper pub ambience with the release of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=520">“Arcade Pool”</a> for the CD32 by taking a DAT tape with them on drinking
sesh and recording forty mins of pub banter/sounds.</p>
<p>The ECTS Awards nominees had been announced, with Sensible Software in the
running for Developer of the Year.</p>
<p>Console games “Pac Attack” and “Metal Marines” looked to be getting Amiga
ports (&lsquo;cept they didn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Thalion were still insisting that a “super enhanced” version of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=687">“Lionheart”</a> was on the way for the CD32.</p>
<p>The One teased news of “at least 5 console conversions” coming to the Amiga,
but it seemed the deal hadn’t quite been signed off on yet.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month’s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1757">“Heimdall 2”</a> demo - Core Design</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3527">“Parattack”</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1713">“Bump ‘n’ Burn”</a> demo - Grandslam</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3768">“Cookie”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a rather silly “interview” with a (fictional) software pirate who
was repenting his evil ways.</p>
<p>Games getting in depth Work In Progress coverage in this issue were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=415">&ldquo;Flight of the Amazon Queen&rdquo;</a> Interactive Binary Illusions/Renegade</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=225">&ldquo;Banshee&rdquo;</a> Core</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5486">&ldquo;Kult of Speed&rdquo;</a> Electronic Arts (unreleased)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1868">&ldquo;Club Football - The Manager&rdquo;</a> Teque London/Imagine Home Entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p>Part 2 of the big feature on Sensible Software. The scoop this month was that
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">&ldquo;Sensible World of Soccer&rdquo;</a> had been pushed back to the start of the
season in August, but to fill the void there&rsquo;d be a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=940">world championship
edition of &ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo;</a> to coincide with the World Cup.</p>
<p>In this month&rsquo;s PD Zone:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Willy&rsquo;s Humungous Adventure&rdquo; Matthew Woodroof 70%</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3768">&ldquo;Cookie&rdquo;</a> 80%</li>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=306">&ldquo;Darkmere&rdquo;</a> Core Design - 82% &ldquo;The game oozes style and the quest is large enough to keep even the most experienced adventurer occupied for several weeks, if not longer.&rdquo; However, this sums up my main gripe: &ldquo;As it stands you&rsquo;re likely to spend hours wandering around trying to fathom out where to go next and because everything is so spread out it&rsquo;s easy to become hopelessly lost.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1770">&ldquo;Manchester United Premier League Champions&rdquo;</a> Krisalis - 80% &ldquo;MUPLC is undoubtedly for those who prefer there to be more to their footy than a straightforward kick-around.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2656">&ldquo;Mega Motion&rdquo;</a> Extend Design/Black Legend - 86% &ldquo;Absolutely brilliant! No, really - no sarcasm at all. I know these screenshots aren&rsquo;t exactly going to make you scream and shout, but once you get the hang of this game, it really is one of the most brain-teasing yet rewarding little doobies I&rsquo;ve played since Gearworks.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2762">&ldquo;Statix&rdquo;</a> 7th Sign/Black Legend - 84% &ldquo;Arcade puzzle games are two-a-penny on the Amiga, but not many come better than Statix. Programmed by a bunch of German demo-coders, it&rsquo;s not only a polished puzzle game, but it&rsquo;s also a damn good variation on a well-worked theme.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1751">&ldquo;Fly Harder&rdquo;</a> Starbyte/Krisalis - 83% &ldquo;I lurve decent Thrust clones and Fly Harder is one of the smartest yet. Thankfully, the team behind the game has refrained from attempting to &rsquo;enhance&rsquo; the traditional gameplay with superfluous things like power-ups - which, let&rsquo;s face it, never really work with older-style games - so what we&rsquo;ve got here is an immediately pickupable (yes, I know, I know) blaster.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=198">&ldquo;Bubble and Squeak&rdquo;</a> Euphoria/Gremlin - 83% &ldquo;Bubble and Squeak is being universally welcomed to our screens as if it was royalty. Why? Because of the &lsquo;wonderful interplay between the two central characters&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s why. Using Squeak to negotiate the trickier sections of each level is an inspired touch and adds an immense amount to the challenge.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=529">&ldquo;Heimdall 2&rdquo;</a> The 8th Day/Core Design - 90% &ldquo;Well, they told us it would be good, but they didn&rsquo;t say it would be this good! Thankfully, all of the hype presented to us in the process of producing our WIP appears to have been well founded, and I&rsquo;m glad to be able to send you down the game shop with my blessing.&rdquo;</li>
