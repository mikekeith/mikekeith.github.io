<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>After months of mystery, Dino Dini&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1408">&ldquo;Kick Off 3&rdquo;</a> was finally
unveiled. Unlike the second instalment which was effectively tweaks and
improvements to the original&rsquo;s codebase, this one was re-coded from the ground
up. Would it be able to take back the crown from <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=941">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo;</a> ?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the Sensi lads hadn&rsquo;t been resting on their laurels and
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=939">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer v1.1&rdquo;</a> was due out next month. Player and club data
had been updated for the new season, and there were other welcome changes such
as re-written goalie behaviour.</p>
<p>The biggest arcade game on the planet was getting an Amiga release. Creative
Materials was in charge of the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1007">&ldquo;Street Fighter 2&rdquo;</a> Amiga port and the
screens they released looked promising. Could it actually best the SNES
version? (of course not - it wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it wasn&rsquo;t a patch on the
SNES).</p>
<p>Microprose were working on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1756">&ldquo;Gunship 2000&rdquo;</a>, a follow up to their
popular helicopter sim. They also had another flight sim in the works in the
form of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=104">&ldquo;B-17 Flying Fortress&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Cryo boss Philippe Ulrich swung by The One to discuss <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=630">&ldquo;K.G.B.&rdquo;</a> and a &ldquo;bizarre strategy game&rdquo; called <a href="http://hol.abime.net/5544">&ldquo;Eden&rdquo;</a> (unreleased). The French developer&rsquo;s previous game was <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=354">&ldquo;Dune&rdquo;</a> (not to be confused with Westwood&rsquo;s outing) and he revealed they were planning CDTV versions of &ldquo;Dune&rdquo; and &ldquo;K.G.B&rdquo; featuring voice acting and, in the case of &ldquo;Dune&rdquo;, digitised footage from David Lynch&rsquo;s film adaptation.</p>
<p>And funnily enough this month saw Virgin announce <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=355">&ldquo;Dune II&rdquo;</a> (by Westwood), which would quite a different experience than Cryo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Core Design were having a crack at the console platformer with
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=335">&ldquo;Doodlebug&rdquo;</a>. Apparently the game turned up on their doorstep already
complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge&rdquo; from System 3 promised arcade style F1 racing
action (unreleased?).</p>
<p>How long had it been since the Amiga 600 launched? 1 month? 2? At any rate,
Commodore slashed £100 off the price and reported the machines were in high
demand at £299. Rumours continued about the Amiga 800 - could we see a reveal
next month?</p>
<p>EA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1588">&ldquo;Road Rash&rdquo;</a> was heading to the Amiga.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=72">&ldquo;Another World&rdquo;</a> creators Eric Chahi and Frederic Savoir had signed a deal with Virgin to publish their next game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness_(video_game)">&ldquo;Heart of Darkness&rdquo;</a> (the development of this would become a bit of an epic tale - it would not appear on the Amiga).</p>
<p>Titus were launching a budget label, Fox Hits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=837">&ldquo;Pinball Dreams&rdquo;</a> had been a hit for 21st Century and they announced
the sequel was due by the end of the year. Apparently it would feature&hellip;
&ldquo;extra flippers&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>A rather good Lemmings/Terminator animated intro had been doing the PD circuit
which suggested <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=677">&ldquo;Lemmings II&rdquo;</a> wasn&rsquo;t far off.</p>
<p>Renegade signed Andrew Braybrook&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1101">&ldquo;Uridium II&rdquo;</a> and expected it to be
out early 1993. The publisher had also picked up the team from defunct
Strangeways Software who were now working on a game called <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=920">&ldquo;Ruff &amp;
Tumble&rdquo;</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=540">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo;</a> was to get a CDTV
version.</p>
<p>And finally&hellip; The One took some enjoyment to point out a year old quote from
Anco <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1417">&ldquo;Kick Off&rdquo;</a> designer and playtester Steve Screech saying that it
would be &ldquo;at least three years before another decent footie game comes out.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month&rsquo;s not two but <em>three</em> coverdisks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=95">&ldquo;Assassin&rdquo;</a> from Team 17 demo</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=630">&ldquo;K.G.B&rdquo;</a> from Cryo/Virgin demo</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1750">&ldquo;Fireforce&rdquo;</a> demo</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1286">&ldquo;Cybernetix&rdquo;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The One took Westwood president, Brett Sperry, down the pub for a chat.</p>
<p>Spoilers galore as Gary Whitta reviewed endings of various games to see
whether they were worth the bother.</p>
<p>Over two years in the making, The Bitmap Brothers&rsquo; much hyped next game -
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=252">&ldquo;The Chaos Engine&rdquo;</a> - was almost here, so Gary Whitta paid them a
visit.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes work-in-progress series on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1782">&ldquo;Frontier&rdquo;</a> drew to a
close with its third and final instalment as the game was approaching release.</p>
<p>An indepth look at the impressive looking <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=674">&ldquo;Legends of Valour&rdquo;</a> - the
Wolf3D-esque raycast renderer has to rate as one of the best seen on the
Amiga. While the game was originally developed on the PC, Novagen&rsquo;s Paul
Woakes was responsible for the Amiga engine.</p>
<p>In this month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1101">&ldquo;Uridium 2&rdquo;</a> dev diary Andrew started tackling the end
of level mini-game (which was quite different to how it would eventually turn
out), worked on some more weapon types and added the high score entry screen.</p>
<p>PD Zone looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/3866">&ldquo;Donkey Kong&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5578">&ldquo;Flag Catcher&rdquo;</a></li>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=926">&ldquo;Putty&rdquo;</a> System 3 - 87% &ldquo;That System 3&rsquo;s programmers have been able to pack so much versatility into Putty yet still make him relatively easy to control is a miracle.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=510">&ldquo;The Humans&rdquo;</a> Mirage - 80% &ldquo;The Humans smacks of class and humour. From the groovy animations illustrating key points in the game to the hilarious caveman band that appears on the high-score table, you&rsquo;ll be smiling broadly during play.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=82">&ldquo;Archer Maclean&rsquo;s Pool&rdquo;</a> Archer Maclean/Virgin - 90% &ldquo;Pool is a big step in the right direction, basing the same excellent engine and player interface around a green-baize game that is so much more suited to computer simulation [compared to Snooker].&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=77">&ldquo;The Aquatic Games&rdquo;</a> Millennium - 84% &ldquo;I think that the Aquatic Games has enough humour and nice touches to warrant a purchase by all but the most sophisticated gamers.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2036">&ldquo;Shuttle&rdquo;</a> Vektor Grafix/Virgin - 81% &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game with much to offer as long as you are prepared to persevere (it really does take some effort) and it&rsquo;s just the job for those long Wintery evenings waiting just around the corner.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=700">&ldquo;Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge&rdquo;</a> Magnetic Fields/Gremlin - 86% &ldquo;At the end of the day, though, Lotus III is a goody. It&rsquo;s more polished and playable than 98% of the competition (for the record it&rsquo;s better than Jaguar, but hasn&rsquo;t quite got the the [sic] edge over the superb Crazy Cars III), has the best soundtrack I&rsquo;ve heard in many a month and on the whole fans of the series won&rsquo;t be disappointed.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1750">&ldquo;Fireforce&rdquo;</a> I.C.E. - 90% &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the graphics put you off - Fireforce is one of the most enjoyable and sophisticated shoot-&rsquo;em-ups I&rsquo;ve played and full marks to I.C.E. for having the bottle to try something with a bit of an edge to it for a change.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2049">&ldquo;Troddlers&rdquo;</a> Storm - 85% &ldquo;Initial appearances can be deceiving, though, and on playing it becomes apparent that Troddlers is not as linear as the DMA classic [Lemmings], with varying missions which don&rsquo;t always involve just guiding the Troddlers to the exit.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1790">&ldquo;Zool&rdquo;</a> Gremlin - 87% &ldquo;&lsquo;Fuller&rsquo; than Robocod, faster than Harlequin and, I think, better than what I&rsquo;ve seen of any of the Mario games (although those dratted Nintendo owners will no doubt be up in arms about that).&rdquo;</li>
