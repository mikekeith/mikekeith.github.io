<h1 id="this-month-in-the-one-for-amiga-92">This month in&hellip; The One for Amiga &lsquo;92</h1>
<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>A new TV show catering for gamers had recently debuted and The One wanted to
hear from readers about what they thought of it. Did Gamesmaster provide what
gaming fans were looking for?</p>
<p>Electronic Arts were to publish <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=240">&ldquo;Castles&rdquo;</a>, a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=965">&ldquo;SimCity&rdquo;</a> meets
RPG game from Interplay.</p>
<p>A new book from Sigma sought to help players struggling to get to grips with
adventure games. &ldquo;The Adventure Gamer&rsquo;s Manual&rdquo; would contain a mix of game
specific and general adventuring tips. I actually found a copy of this in a
local bookstore around 2000 - completely random.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated next instalment in the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=199">&ldquo;Bubble Bobble&rdquo;</a> series
was heading to home computers. Ocean would be publishing the conversion of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=819">&ldquo;Parasol Stars&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than having to break out, Inforgrames&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=53">&ldquo;Alcatraz&rdquo;</a>would see the
player having to raid the prison and take it back from terrorists.</p>
<p>While Nintendo had Mario and Sega Sonic, the Amiga had yet to find a
platformer mascot of its own. Would the upcoming <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1065">&ldquo;Titus the Fox&rdquo;</a> from
French software house Titus fill that void?</p>
<p>Core Design was working on not one but two racing games with the Jaguar
license. <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1199">&ldquo;Jaguar XJ220 Sports Racing&rdquo;</a> would take place in 12 different
countries, while the second would be based around the Le Mans 24 hour race.
Both games were being programmed by Mark Avory, who had apparently also made
good progress on a 3D vector racing engine (the two Jag games would be sprite
based).</p>
<p>Were we about to enter the golden period for Sensible Software? They revealed
their next three games: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1215">&ldquo;Wizkid&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=941">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo;</a> and
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">&ldquo;Cannon Fodder&rdquo;</a>. All three rank amongst the greatest Amiga games ever
made.</p>
<p>The demise of Mirrorsoft the previous year left a lot of developers without a
publisher. Some games were being transferred to Acclaim, but others were in
limbo. One such title trying to find a home was Graftgold&rsquo;s rather excellent
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1749">&ldquo;Fire and Ice&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Spielberg&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1269">&ldquo;Hook&rdquo;</a> had been a hit at the box office and Ocean hoped
that would translate into a big selling game.</p>
<p>Infogrames struck a deal with Disney to bring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and
the like to home computers. The first game up for release would star Roger
Rabbit in <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1746">&ldquo;Hare Raising Havoc&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The programmer behind <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1344">&ldquo;Switchblade 2&rdquo;</a> was working on an impressive
looking platformer. <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1790">&ldquo;Zool&rdquo;</a> would see the player take on role of a
ninja ant (yes, Gremlin&rsquo;s Ian Richardson described it as a &ldquo;ninja ant&rdquo;) in
colourful candy filled levels, and was expected to be on shelves sometime in
the summer.</p>
<p>Grandslam was going to have a crack at the rather crowded golf sim genre with
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1784">&ldquo;Nick Faldo&rsquo;s Golf&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>200 exhibitors and 40,000 visitors were anticipated for the upcoming Spring
Computer Shopper Show at Olympia in May.</p>
<p>Joystick manufacturer Spectravideo were adding a few more models to its Logic3
range.</p>
<p>Talking Birds, developer of <a href="http://hol.abime.net/603">&ldquo;Football Tactician&rdquo;</a>, promised a year of
free update disks of all 440 players in the first division.</p>
<p>The next subject to be tackled by sim specialist Maxis would be&hellip; ants.
According to Jeff Braun, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1207">&ldquo;SimAnt&rdquo;</a> was an &ldquo;apology for
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1815">&ldquo;SimEarth&rdquo;</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adventure game legend Fergus McNeill had turned his attention to spaghetti
westerns with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3243">&ldquo;Town With No Name&rdquo;</a>, an FMV game for the CDTV.</p>
<p>Hex, a team that had specialised in visuals for music videos, felt that games
looked &ldquo;sterile&rdquo; and that their new technique of video sampling would remedy
that in <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2649">&ldquo;Top Banana&rdquo;</a>&hellip; they certainly succeeded in producing
something that could not be described as sterile. This game was examined in
one of my favourite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SEJZpn7W0w">Amigos podcast episodes</a>. Extra amusing as the
programmer is an old workmate &amp; friend.</p>
<p>When one thinks of player characters, I doubt the role of a tomato comes to
mind, but Psygnosis were doing that in the appropriately named<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=160">&ldquo;Tomato
Game&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Running a successful airline was the goal of biz sim <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=50">&ldquo;Air Bucks&rdquo;</a> from
Impressions.</p>
<p>The classic footie management game <a href="http://hol.abime.net/2978">&ldquo;Championship Manager&rdquo;</a> was about to
debut.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>This month Al Lowe (<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2022">&ldquo;Leisure Suit Larry&rdquo;</a> etc) and Steve Turner
(<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001503">&ldquo;Dragontorc&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004022">&ldquo;Ranarama&rdquo;</a> etc) got the developer profile
treatment.</p>
<p>The One gave <a href="http://weltenschule.de/TableHooters/Mindscape_MiraclePiano.html">“The Miracle”</a> - a piano tutor package complete with
keyboard - from Mindscape a whirl. The verdict? The software was decent, but
the keyboard wasn’t up to much - especially for £299.</p>
<p>Games PR person Danielle “Woody” Woodyatt described her ideal compilation.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=29">&ldquo;The Addams Family&rdquo;</a> Ocean</li>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=36">“The Adventures of Willy Beamish”</a> Dynamix - 84% “And not only does it look good and sound good, it also plays well. You can do what YOU want, go where YOU want, and basically do everything and anything that comes to mind.” (one would hope so the graphics and audio were good - it came on a whopping 12 disks!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1413">“Indy Heat”</a> Storm - 86% “To release this type of game years after the original concept came out seems a bit strange. But I must admit, getting back to the basic race-around-a-track type of game is good mindless fun.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1108">“Video Kid”</a> Gremlin - 82% “Video Kid is good fun and good value and could be just what you’re looking for to pass a few boring hours with, that is simple, unadulterated fun.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=358">“Dynablaster”</a> Ubisoft - 87% “As always in this type of game, the multi-player option is by far the best bet and this one will have you coming back time and time again.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=165">“Black Crypt”</a> Electronic Arts - 92% “It has to be said, Black Crypt is easily the best 3D role-playing game available on the Amiga.”</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/1039">“PGA Tour Golf: Tournament Course Pack”</a> Electronic Arts - 85% “For the regular player who’s grown bored of seeing the same old courses, a data disk is just fine (and the presence of a ‘next page’ icon on the course selection screen, indicating that there are presumably more courses to come will no doubt also please) but it’s an overhaul most of us are looking for and is what is needed to put it on par (no pun intended) with the superior&hellip; [the review stops abruptly there, but I imagine he was going to say Microprose Golf]”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3390">“Harpoon: The Med Conflict”</a> Electronic Arts - 84% “Apart from the scenarios and extra craft, this game is essentially unchanged from the original. This comes as a bit of a disappointment really, as there are plenty of enhancements that could have been made.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1234">“Shadowlands”</a> Domark - 93% “Shadowlands owes a lot to a number of previous RPGs, but even more to the fine talents of Teque London: it’s one of the best dungeon-delving role-playing games to come along since Eye of the Beholder.”</li>
