            <p>Once again a depressing amount of time has passed since my last update. Given
what&rsquo;s on my plate workwise over the next few months I suspect the sporadic
nature of my posts will continue. Thankfully I have continued to find time to
chip away at the game, and some progress has been made.</p>
<p>After I managed to get a super rough first pass of the (very) initial base of
the game done (with the balls/bubbles/whatever falling down the board and
stacking up correctly), the next thing to tackle was the colour matching. This
ended up being a rather humbling endeavour as my initial confidence met the
realities of my inexperience with 6502 coding.</p>
<p>The first step was get the connecting neighbours for each any given cell on
the board, which was straightforward enough.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018-05-20-2018520diary-of-a-game-part-2-matching-and-testing/neighbourscapture.gif" alt="Finding the neighbours of each cell."></p>
<p>Finding the neighbours of each cell.</p>
<p>With a simple routine to return a list of neighbours for a given cell, I could
move on to figuring out all of the matching connected items. This is where
things got a little complicated. The board on which the items appear can be
viewed as a graph/network of connected nodes. Most nodes have up to 6
neighbours, whereas those on the edges &amp; corners of the board have up to 2, 3
or 4 depending on their position. Chains of connected items can potentially
use every cell on the board. So I decided to use a basic graph/network search,
which looks something like &hellip;<br>
For a given item:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push the item onto the &ldquo;open&rdquo; stack (items that need to be visited)</li>
<li>While the open stack has items on it:</li>
<li>Pop an item</li>
<li>Mark it as matched &amp; visited</li>
<li>Get a list of matching neighbours</li>
<li>Iterate through each neighbour, and if they haven&rsquo;t been visited then push them onto the open stack.</li>
<li>Go to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>While this is the kind of thing I&rsquo;ve done many times in more fully featured
languages, I really struggled to get my head around doing it with 6502. The
fact that I didn&rsquo;t have decent chunks of time to sit down and focus on it
didn&rsquo;t help. I eventually got there, though, and the moment where it finally
worked was one of the most satisfying achievements for me in recent times,
which is somewhat amusing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018-05-20-2018520diary-of-a-game-part-2-matching-and-testing/fullmatchingcapture.gif" alt="Testing the matching chains of items."></p>
<p>Testing the matching chains of items.</p>
<p>What this all highlighted for me was that I really needed to spend some time
improving my testing and debugging process. The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/">C64Debugger</a> was
useful, though I just can not seem to get it to load symbols - I keep meaning
to download the source and have a poke around. I had never really explored
debugging in VICE, but I found <a href="http://www.vintageisthenewold.com/debugging-6502-assembly-doesnt-have-to-be-awful-retrochallenge-2018-04-update-9/">this blog post</a> a great introduction.
Once I realised I could load symbols, VICE was a huge help (I had previously
been manually printing out addresses at compile time in
<a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage">KickAssembler</a>).</p>
<p>But as I went back to refactor and optimise routines I found myself getting
pretty frustrated at subtle bugs creeping in which became difficult to track
down. Thankfully there is a nice unit test solution for the C64. Yes, unit
testing on the C64. Michael Taszycki of the excellent <a href="https://64bites.com/">64Bites</a> video
series has created the <a href="https://64bites.com/64spec/">64spec</a> framework, which allows you to setup
unit tests and run them on the 64 (or in an emulator). This now allows me to
make changes and have some confidence that if I break anything I&rsquo;ll be able to
catch it early.</p>

<p>Oh dear, something went wrong somewhere. Time to debug.</p>
<p>And so now things are at the point where balls/bubbles/whatever fall down,
stack up and get removed when chains of 3+ matching items are found. Next on
my plate is some more refactoring and optimisation, then I need to tackle
using sprites for the moving items so they look a little less crap.</p>
