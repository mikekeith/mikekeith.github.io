<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>After months of speculation, Amstrad finally revealed their 16bit Sinclair. It
was not, as many thought, a games console, but a rather unimpressive PC. The
reception was luke warm at best: &ldquo;is Amstrad&rsquo;s Sinclair a powerless business
computer or a games machine that&rsquo;s unsuitable for games?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, excitement was riding high for the Konix console. The release date
was to be January 28th and would include a bunch of add ons, including the
hydraulic chair. It was hard not to get caught up in the wave of hype for this</p>
<ul>
<li>it promised to finally deliver a proper arcade experience. Of course it was
not to be and the machine went down in videogame folklore. It&rsquo;s worth checking
out <a href="http://www.konixmultisystem.co.uk/">the brilliant site</a> dedicated to collecting information about the
fabled system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Jobs revealed that the first machine from his new company after being
kicked out of Apple would be the NeXT and ship in the US this month.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Spain&rsquo;s leading game software house Dinamic was profiled.</p>
<p>Wild Bill Stealey - president of Microprose - held a press event where he took
journos for a spin in his 1955 T-28 Trojan acrobatic Navy plane (called &ldquo;Miss
MicroProse&rdquo;). Apparently it was a rather terrifying/stomach-churning
experience.</p>
<p>Mel Croucher took a look at how technology was helping disabled people.</p>
<p>There was a supplement with a series of articles looking at various aspects of
electronic music production (keyboards, MIDI, synths, samplers, drum machines
etc).</p>
<p>&ldquo;STOS The Game Creator&rdquo; from Mandarin Software for the ST was examined. At
only Â£29.95 this looked like an essential purchase for ST owners who wanted to
start dabbling in game development.</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s focus in the Cyberpunk feature was Robocop. TGM went over the
film and talked to the folks at Ocean who were busy working on the game of the
movie.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s newest newspaper, The Post, embraced new technology and was produced
entirely on Macs using off the shelf software like PageMaker. TGM got a sneak
peek behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Mel Croucher surveyed the current &ldquo;personal stereos&rdquo; (i.e. walkmen) on the
market and came up with a list of best buys.</p>
<p>A section dedicated to Nintendo (was it an advertisement or an article?)
summarised a whole bunch of games and peripherals for the NES available in the
UK.</p>
<p>A hardware guide at the back listed vital stats for all the main gaming
platforms out in the UK.</p>
<h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=774">&ldquo;Navy Moves&rdquo;</a> Dinamic - Amstrad/C64/Spectrum/ST/Amiga/PC &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an impossible mission beneath the sea, like a cross between Where Eagle&rsquo;s Dare and Magnetic Scrolls&rsquo; Fish!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=158">&ldquo;Aspar GP Master&rdquo;</a> Dinamic - Amstrad/C64/Spectrum/ST/Amiga &ldquo;Aspar GP Master looks like good rip-roaring fun. Let&rsquo;s hope this is one game that doesn&rsquo;t die with its slippers on.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Aspar&rdquo; means &ldquo;slipper&rdquo; in Catalan)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=130">&ldquo;Batman: The Caped Crusader&rdquo;</a> Special FX/Ocean - Spectrum/C64/Amstrad/ST/Amiga &ldquo;So close [to the comic], in fact, that the screen itself starts to look like a hectic page of classic DC artwork - when you leave one room, the next is superimposed on it in the style of comic books, where one frame juts into the next.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=413">&ldquo;Fish!&rdquo;</a> Magnetic Scrolls - ST/Amiga 88% &ldquo;This is the best Magnetic Scrolls adventure I have played to date - surpassing even the delights of The Guild of Thieves.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=132">&ldquo;Battle Chess&rdquo;</a> Interplay/EA - Amiga 83% &ldquo;The animation and high definition graphics have to be seen to be believed, figures walk around the screen, fight and perform various actions with incredible realism.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=967">&ldquo;Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon&rdquo;</a> Cinemaware/Mirrorsoft - Amiga 81% &ldquo;While the strategy and arcade scenes are limited, and repetitiveness a real danger, this is an attractive and enjoyable game.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2117">&ldquo;Red Storm Rising&rdquo;</a> Microprose - C64 86% &ldquo;The overall effect is of a technically stunning program which compliments the novel perfectly.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=148">&ldquo;Armalyte&rdquo;</a> Thalamus - C64 90% &ldquo;Horizontally scrolling shoot-&rsquo;em-ups are as old as the Commodore 64, but this is a particularly professional and well-detailed implementation which even Fasoulas would be proud of.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; Zortech - PC 88% &ldquo;A wide range of emotions can be brought out by this program, from joy to anger, as the trials and tribulations of your companies are played out on the screen.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1968">&ldquo;Pool of Radiance&rdquo;</a> SSI/US Gold - C64 89% &ldquo;SSI have crammed so much into this game that it&rsquo;s literally bursting at the seams.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=596">&ldquo;Cybernoid II&rdquo;</a> Raffaele Cecco/Hewson - C64 87% Spectrum 85% &ldquo;If you are new to this game and its predecessor, or are hungry for more of the same, Cybernoid II offers plenty of shoot-&rsquo;em-up arcade-action thrills.&rdquo;</li>
