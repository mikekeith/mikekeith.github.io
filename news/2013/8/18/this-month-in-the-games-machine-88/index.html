<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Commodore had been reluctant to try to bring the Amiga&rsquo;s price in line with
the cheaper Atari ST, but this month the long rumoured £100 cut happened. The
ST had stormed ahead in sales and it looked like it would be a tough battle
for the Amiga, which Commodore had originally pitched as a business machine
but was now accepting that it&rsquo;s destiny would be games.</p>
<p>Sugar&rsquo;s Amstrad entered into a partnership with Murdoch&rsquo;s Sky satellite TV
company which would see Amstrad producing and selling £199 dishes that would
receive the four Sky channels once the service launched early in the following
year. Robert Maxwell&rsquo;s BSB was also in the running, but had received some
scorn due to adopting an arguably superior format other than PAL meaning
separate dishes would be required.</p>
<p>Code Masters were about to move into full price (£9.99) games. No titles were
mentioned, but rather than going for more complex games they would be throwing
in freebies (tshirts etc).</p>
<p>EA&rsquo;s lineup for Apple computers (II, IIgs and Mac) would finally be released
in the UK.</p>
<p>A slightly odd line of products was released by Trilogic whereby old C64/128
machines could be re-used by new Amiga owners as printer buffers. I&rsquo;m not sure
just how much need for this there was.</p>
<p>Amstrad was gearing up to launch a new computer to take on the 16bit machines.
It would be called the Sinclair Professional PC, cost £299 and run MS-DOS.
Scepticism was high over its ability to compete with the Amiga: &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be
both a PC compatible and an Amiga-killer.&rdquo; Meanwhile, it looked like Amstrad
was determined to sell off its stock of Spectrum +2s and +3s - was a +4 on the
way? There were also completely contradictory reports of the fate of Amstrad&rsquo;s
rumoured low cost (£50) console - it was either cancelled with the team having
left the company, or &ldquo;hundreds of thousands&rdquo; of units had been ordered.</p>
<p>CD manufacturer Nimbus expressed concerns that the new format may only
actually last up to 8 years before deterioating, rather than the much promoted
&ldquo;lifetime&rdquo;. In other CD news, Sony had begun production of mini CDs for
singles after a pronounced argument with Philips over the fact the new size
would not play in some players. The compromise would be to include a ring
adapter.</p>
<p>Toshiba were manufacturing full colour LCD TV screens that were 4&quot; across. TGM
were somewhat baffled as to why such a thing would be made&hellip;</p>
<p>WH Smith, Boots and Woolworths were putting their combined feet down over
irregular shaped game boxes that were causing them considerable annoyance to
stock on shelves. From now on, only a small set of box sizes would be allowed</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mel Croucher took on people claiming their creative endeavours were original - &ldquo;&hellip;there is no such thing as a new idea. All ideas and treatments of those ideas are recycled time and time again.&rdquo; He cited a number of examples from the movie industry: &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; (an episode of &ldquo;Lost in Space&rdquo;), &ldquo;Blade Runner&rdquo; (an episode of &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo;), and &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Snow Queen&rdquo;).</li>
<li>TGM&rsquo;s series on Cyberpunk continued, this month looking at Cyberpunk on the screen. &ldquo;Aliens&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blade Runner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Max Headroom&rdquo; were all discussed in some depth.</li>
<li>The first home release of &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Lair&rdquo; arrived for the ST and received a full feature. It all seemed to stackup well against the original, but at £99.95 for the laser disc, £19.95 for the cable and £400-800 for the disc player it&rsquo;d be hard to justify.</li>
<li>Mel Croucher surveyed various video gismos to enhance one&rsquo;s video work: titlers, microphones, fader/mixers, enhancers and even designer raincoats for camcorders.</li>
<li>A silly piece on haunted computers of press publications.</li>
<li>The first National Computer Games Championship held in Britain was under way with the first few rounds having been completed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li>Audiogenic were making the switch from &ldquo;less popular&rdquo; 8bit machines which were getting a bit long in the tooth to the ST and Amiga. The first two 16bit titles up were <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2200">&ldquo;Helter Skelter&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=371">&ldquo;Emlyn Hughes International Soccer&rdquo;</a>. The highly regarded Binary Design team had been commissioned to produce a big game for Christmas, but there were no details.</li>
<li>Activision was readying a batch of ports of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=918">&ldquo;R-Type&rdquo;</a> for home computers. Like with many ports they all varied in quality and content.</li>
<li>Gremlin were finishing up a game in which you play a TRex trying to retrieve your stolen eggs, which results in destroying much of Japan. The game was previewed as &ldquo;T-Wrecks&rdquo; but ended up being released as <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=3942">&ldquo;The Muncher&rdquo;</a> as part of a Chewits production.</li>
<li>Mastertronic signed a deal with Psygnosis to bring <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=214">&ldquo;Barbarian&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2623">&ldquo;Terrorpods&rdquo;</a> to 8bit machines. An ambitious task to say the least.</li>
<li>After the success of the original, Rainbow Arts were busy on a sequel to Giana Sisters titled &ldquo;Arthur and Marthur: Giana Twins In Future World&rdquo;. By the looks of this it never made it out, presumably due to the the lawsuits from Nintendo.</li>
<li>Microprose had almost finished <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1465">&ldquo;Red Storm Rising&rdquo;</a> - an arcade strategy epic based on Clancy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hunt for Red October&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There was a more in depth preview of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2421">&ldquo;The Kristal&rdquo;</a> - the game that originally started off as a stage musical. The game&rsquo;s director claimed it would be &ldquo;the biggest game ever!&rdquo;. It didn&rsquo;t really live up to the hype..</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005671">&ldquo;Where Time Stood Still&rdquo;</a> Denton Designs/Ocean - Spectrum 128 95% &ldquo;An instant classic on the Spectrum - the game&rsquo;s great wealth of graphic detail is suggestive of a black and white movie.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=215">&ldquo;Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax&rdquo;</a> Palace Software - C64 94% &ldquo;This is a brilliant arcade/adventure on disk and although we haven&rsquo;t played the cassette version yet, each level seems substantial enough to make multiload a very minor irritation.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003170">&ldquo;Mickey Mouse&rdquo;</a> Gremlin Graphics - Spectrum 87% &ldquo;While neither the tower section or any of the subgames set new standards for the Spectrum, they&rsquo;re well-integrated and produce a surprisingly addictive game overall.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1154">&ldquo;Hawkeye&rdquo;</a> Boys Without Brains/Thalamus - C64 80% &ldquo;Hawkeye is a good version of a tried and tested format.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1557">&ldquo;Corruption&rdquo;</a> Magnetic Scrolls/Rainbird - ST 73% &ldquo;Corruption is like unto a jelly that won&rsquo;t quite set, it has all the best ingredients but they just don&rsquo;t gel.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3075">&ldquo;Mindfighter&rdquo;</a> Abstract Concepts - ST 45% &ldquo;I hope Abstract Concept&rsquo;s next adventure will be a substantial improvement, after all the authers are very nice people.&rdquo; I also had high hopes for this Fergus McNeill provided some of my favourite gaming moments with the Delta4 games, but this fell well short.</li>
