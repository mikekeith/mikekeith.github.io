<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>US Gold had signed the licenses to a couple of Disney games, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2861">&ldquo;Winnie the Pooh
in the Hundred Acre Wood&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=747">&ldquo;Donald Duck&rsquo;s Playground&rdquo;</a>. Both
were aimed at children, and both were written by Al Lowe (including the
music).</p>
<p>Even though Ocean had been publishing Konami&rsquo;s games in the US, they were
strangely absent from UK shelves. This was about to change with
<a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1258">&ldquo;Hypersports&rdquo;</a>, followed by &ldquo;Konami Tennis&rdquo;, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2919">&ldquo;Yie Ar Kung-Fu&rdquo;</a>,
&ldquo;Hyper Rally&rdquo;, &ldquo;Golf&rdquo;, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1679">&ldquo;Mikie&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=524">&ldquo;Comic Bakery&rdquo;</a>. I might be
wrong, but I <em>think</em> &ldquo;Hypersports&rdquo; was Martin Galway&rsquo;s debut.</p>
<p>There was a slightly snarky note that Domark had appeared to give every
Commodore mag an &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; of the new Bond game (C&amp;VG had run it&rsquo;s
&ldquo;developer diary&rdquo; for several months).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=2035">&ldquo;Quake Minus One&rdquo;</a> was to be the new game from Mike Singleton and Warren
Foulkes. It was due for release on the Spectrum and C64, but only the latter
made it out.</p>
<p>Ocean were touting their novel use of an audio cassette included with their
<a href="http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=971">&ldquo;Frankie Goes to Hollywood&rdquo;</a> game which not only included an exclusive
mix of &ldquo;Relax&rdquo;, but also included instructions on how to play the game.
Apparently they hadn&rsquo;t seen <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001373">&ldquo;Deus Ex Machina&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The designer of the month was Vaughan Dow - a former RAF Harrier jump jet
pilot - who had just finished up his latest game <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1392">&ldquo;Jump Jet&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>St Bride&rsquo;s (&ldquo;where grown women pay for the chance to re-live their jolly
hockey sticks schooldays&rdquo;) announced <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006951">&ldquo;The Secret of St Bride&rsquo;s&rdquo;</a>.
Headmistress of the school, Miss Scarlett, promised this would be the first of
a series of &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; games.</p>
<p>A new Multi User Dungeon was in the works, this time titled MUNG (Multi User
Network Game).</p>
<p>The excellent &ldquo;Commando&rdquo; hit the arcades.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tony Takoushi lamented the fact that many great games released in the US and Europe never make it to the UK. There was a huge list of games for the C64 and Atari machines, but many were eventually released and some titles mentioned were somewhat bizarrely cracks of UK games.</li>
<li>Max Headroom was &ldquo;interviewed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>There was a roundup of &ldquo;computer graphics packages&rdquo; that were available for home computers.</li>
<li>Atari&rsquo;s efforts in the home computer market were examined. They had failed to find any real success despite shipping arguably superior hardware earlier than competitors. C&amp;VG&rsquo;s theory about cause of this? The high prices US software houses were charging ($30ish). The hope was that the new ST computers would turn things around.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2824">&ldquo;Way of the Exploding Fist&rdquo;</a> Melbourne House - C64 Game of the Month 10/10 &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t make up your mind on which game to buy this month, you could do a lot worse than splash out on The Way of the Exploding Fist.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001848">&ldquo;Frank Bruno&rsquo;s Boxing&rdquo;</a> Elite - Spectrum/C64/Amstrad Blitz Game 10/10 &ldquo;Overall a great sports simulation. The animation is great and play action really addictive. A champion game!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002295">&ldquo;Herbert&rsquo;s Dummy Run&rdquo;</a> Mikro-Gen - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;Mikro-Gen are one of the few companies who consistently release better and better software. Herbert&rsquo;s Dummy Run is no exception.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001538">&ldquo;Dun Darach&rdquo;</a> Gargoyle Games - Spectrum Blitz Game 10/10 &ldquo;Dun Darach is an entertaining game. It has real atmosphere - you really feel as if you are pounding the streets of a strange city&hellip;. It&rsquo;s also a real step forward for the arcade animation adventure game.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/?game_id=1392">&ldquo;Jump Jet&rdquo;</a> Anirog - C64 9/10 &ldquo;For those who like flight simulations, Jump Jet is well worth buying.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dropzone&rdquo; Archer MacLean/US Gold - Atari 8/10 &ldquo;The graphics are excellent and the high-speed scrolling screen allows fast and very smooth as you blast nine different alien attackers.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=777">&ldquo;Dragonworld&rdquo;</a> Telarium - C64 9/10 &ldquo;I must say that Dragonworld is on of the better adventures I have played for some time, and should provide many hours of spills and thrills for adventurers of moderate skill.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=346">&ldquo;Bored of the Rings&rdquo;</a> Delta4 - Spectrum/C64 8/10 &ldquo;Bored of the Rings is a must for Hobbit-haters, and lovers of parody.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li>There was a long and detailed preview of<a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2530">&ldquo;Summer Games 2&rdquo;</a> from Epyx. Anticipation was high.</li>
