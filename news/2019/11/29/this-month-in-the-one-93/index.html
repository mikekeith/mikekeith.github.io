<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>The CD32 launch hadn&rsquo;t exactly gotten off to a great start, with sales looking
rather lacklustre. To try to turn things around Commodore kicked off a
marketing push starting with a big presence at the Live &lsquo;93 exhibition and an
upcoming TV advert. Satellite stations would be targeted first before
switching to ITV and C4 over the Christmas period. Apparently Live &lsquo;93 was
such a big hit that Commodore had already booked its presence at next year&rsquo;s
event. At this stage there was around 15 titles available for the console with
25 more due in the next &ldquo;couple of months&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Chris Evans and Gaby Roslin from The Big Breakfast were on hand to open HMV&rsquo;s
new flagship &ldquo;Level One&rdquo; video game department at its Oxford Street store. The
chain challenged other retailers to provide &ldquo;the video games fan with a more
exciting shopping environment.&rdquo; Along with a 25-screen video wall, punters
could look forward to 5,000 titles on the shelves.</p>
<p>Millenium were to hold a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=196">&ldquo;Brutal Sports Football&rdquo;</a> competition/event at
&ldquo;Level One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did CNN&rsquo;s Joe McGann, Children&rsquo;s BBC&rsquo;s Andi Peters, Top of the Pops&rsquo;s
Tony Dortie and ABBA cover band Bjorn Again have in common? They had all been
enlisted by Codemasters to declare their love for <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1892">&ldquo;Cosmic Spacehead&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>With its latest release <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=880">&ldquo;Qwak&rdquo;</a>, Team 17 had secured the top four spots
on the budget chart. The other titles were <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2035">&ldquo;Project-X&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=57">&ldquo;Alien Breed
Special Edition&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392">&ldquo;F17 Challenge&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;94 World Cup was approaching which meant we’d soon be inundated with
footie games. One of the first due to appear was Rage&rsquo;s &ldquo;Striker 2&rdquo;, which
they were confident would improve &ldquo;beyond recognition&rdquo; over its predecessor.
(ureleased)</p>
<p>Bucking the recent trend of increasingly weird joysticks, Logic 3 was to
release a &ldquo;square box and straight shaft&rdquo; style one.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an odd one.. UK tabloid The Sun had decided to give game development a
go. <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2884">&ldquo;Snapperazzi&rdquo;</a> was shown at Live &lsquo;93 and featured the exploits of
an alien news photographer. Not only would it receive significant editorial
support, but related competitions were planned and they even had in game
promotions for Domino&rsquo;s Pizza and Fizzy Chewits.</p>
<p>Future Zone claimed it was now the biggest gaming store chain in the country
following the opening of a further three shops, bringing the total to 31
(which was one more than rivals Virgin Games).</p>
<p>Educational software house Lander had reduced the prices of some of its best
known applications to £9.99.</p>
<p>Sierra Online were so confident of the quality of their games they started a
new &ldquo;Guaranteed Enjoyment&rdquo; promotion where they would exchange any of their
games within 21 days of purchase if the customer wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<p>Mike Singleton&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1376">&ldquo;Ashes of Empire&rdquo;</a> was to get a re-release on the
Action Sixteen label.</p>
<p>Daily Mirror cartoonist Roger Mahoney had started a new comic strip based on
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=926">&ldquo;Putty&rdquo;</a>. While he hadn&rsquo;t found a publisher yet, he was confident
someone would pick it up.</p>

</ul>
<p>I had no idea the conference existed back then, but Develop! 93 took place in
Islington during the same week as the Autumn ECTS. The One went along to see
what was going on in the game development world. There was a growing concern
over the ever increasing budgets and team sizes required for producing new
games - gone were the days of the bedroom coder knocking out games in a few
months. In addition to that the industry had attracted the attention of non-
gaming titans like Time-Warner, 20th Century Fox and IBM. Other stories from
Develop covered in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manga artist Satomi Mikuriya was unhappy at the number of trees sacrificed to produce the comics he drew for and had come up with a CD authoring system that would allow an entire animated comic CD to be created in mere hours and cost less than £3000. This, he proposed, would allow CD based publications to retail for around £5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psygnosis&rsquo; Ian Hetherington predicted we would see consoles capable of updating &ldquo;every single pixel on a high-resolution screen, individually rendered in millions of colours, sixty times a second&hellip; and more&hellip;&rdquo; by the end of the decade. He feared that game developers weren&rsquo;t ready for such a seismic shift which could result in demand for traditional skills falling by the way side, replaced by &ldquo;emotional realism, storytelling and editing.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris Crawford (creator of games like <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3314">&ldquo;Balance of Power&rdquo;</a>, and founder of the Computer Game Developers Conference) warned devs that &ldquo;unless we spend more time developing more subtle scenarios than Kill, Slash and Score, we&rsquo;ll all have lost interest in games by the time we&rsquo;re 25 or older&rdquo;. Hmm. He was working on a new game and had spent over two years just on the facial animation. He expected it to be finished in a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One pertinent question for Amiga fans was: given the impending launches of the Jaguar, 3DO and Nintendo/Silicon Graphics &ldquo;monster machine&rdquo;, should I buy a CD32? Apparently almost every developer there working on CD titles was &ldquo;using code that could easily be converted for different machines. So whether you end up with a 3DO machine or a CD32 may not make much difference after all&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An interview with DMA Design which ended with them admitting that piracy meant
it was no longer viable for them to support the Amiga&hellip; Though they did
express interest in the CD32.</p>

<p>After 6 months, work on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=56">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a> was drawing to close, and that
meant the final instalment of the dev diary. Beta-testing was well underway
with only final tweaks to be done. There wasn&rsquo;t much in the way of updates
from the team, but the good news was that Martyn&rsquo;s month long post-ECTS
hangover had finally passed.</p>
<p>There was a rather amusing &ldquo;day in the life of The One&rdquo; feature.</p>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1782">&ldquo;Frontier&rdquo;</a> David Braben/Gametek - 96% &ldquo;Like Elite before it, Frontier is a game that rises above its feeble competitors like a colossus and will be talked about in awe and admiration for years to come. It&rsquo;s better than you could ever have dreamed it to be.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1138">&ldquo;Wiz&rsquo;n&rsquo;Liz&rdquo;</a> Raising Hell Software/Psygnosis - 86% &ldquo;Wiz &rsquo;n&rsquo; Liz has been well received on the Mega Drive and I&rsquo;m glad to say that it&rsquo;s survived the conversion to the humble Amiga extremely well. Everything about it screams &lsquo;sharp, cute and well presented&rsquo;, right down to all the nice little touches like the numerous sub-games and spell effects.&rdquo; (I love this game - still play it to this day)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1101">&ldquo;Uridium 2&rdquo;</a> Graftgold/Renegade - 91% &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve acquired that ability [to pilot the Manta skillfully], however - and it doesn&rsquo;t take that long, to be honest - you&rsquo;ll find Uridium 2 one of the dreamiest, most satisfying blasts you&rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of playing.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=334">&ldquo;Donk!&rdquo;</a> The Hidden/Supervision - 80% &ldquo;Donk! looks stunning, no two ways about it - the parallaxed backdrops are simply gorgeous - but as platform games Donk! holds few surprises other than how good it looks.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=196">&ldquo;Brutal Sports Football&rdquo;</a> Millennium - 88% &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely to be able to play a game where you don&rsquo;t get sent off every time you hack someone down, let alone hacking their heads off. The game may look as though it could get repetitive, but there are enough icons and different moves available to keep you happy for ages and ages.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809">&ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;</a> Psionic Systems/Team 17 - 83% &ldquo;Arriving just a month after the incredible Micro Machines, Overdrive was always going to have a hard job impressing us, especially with expectations running so high after such a long time in development. It&rsquo;s no surprise to discover, then, that Overdrive is a slight disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=880">&ldquo;Qwak&rdquo;</a> Team 17 - 88% &ldquo;Qwak - brilliantly simple, simply brilliant. Ah, at last, a chance to use that dodgy cliche. But what else can I say? Qwak is yet another goal for Team 17 - it&rsquo;s just soooo playable.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1667">&ldquo;Beneath a Steel Sky&rdquo;</a> Revolution/Virgin - 93% &ldquo;Steel Sky is a real eye-opener - once you&rsquo;ve seen the way that background objects move just for the hell of it (after all, the odd fan rotating doesn&rsquo;t enhance the adventure, does it?), you&rsquo;ll never be able to focus on the virtually static screens of the LucasArts games again.&rdquo;</p>
