<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>In an effort to draw some attention away from the other popular gaming
mascots, Mindscape decided to enter <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=223">&ldquo;Alfred the Chicken&rdquo;</a> in the
Christchurch by-election. Alfred managed to bring in 18 votes - two ahead of
the Rainbow Alliance Party. The resulting media &ldquo;circus&rdquo; was certainly worth
the 500 quid it cost them.</p>
<p>Europress teased some screen shots of racing sim <a href="http://hol.abime.net/4842">&ldquo;Rally&rdquo;</a>, though they
were from the PC version. The One reckoned there would be a corresponding 256
colour version for the A1200 &amp; A4000&hellip; (it never made it to the Amiga)</p>
<p>The Live &lsquo;93 consumer electronics show was to take place at Olympia in London
between the 16th and 20th of September.</p>
<p>Codemasters had been focussing their attention on the Mega Drive but were
going to show the Amiga some love again with a port of their hit <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=743">&ldquo;Micro
Machines&rdquo;</a> and a new arcade adventure, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1892">&ldquo;Cosmic Spacehead&rdquo;</a>. The
latter was to have a making of documentary broadcast on Central Television in
October, with a November release.</p>
<p>Trying to brush off the recent financial problems, Commodore anticipated
selling 400,000 CD32s throughout Europe in the run up to Christmas. They
forecast a total of 450,000 units shifted in the UK for all of 1993, comprised
of 220,000 A1200s, 180,000 CD32s and 50,000 A600s. While the numbers seem a
tad&hellip; optimistic, that would only be 50,000 more than the previous year.</p>
<p>Teeny Weeny games signed the rights to Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discworld&rdquo; novels,
though fans would have to be patient as the first title wasn&rsquo;t planned for
release until Christmas &lsquo;94. (Not released on the Amiga)</p>
<p>US publisher Gametek had set up shop in the UK, with the first titles planned
for release being <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1675">&ldquo;Nascar&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=70">&ldquo;American Gladiators&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=510">&ldquo;The
Humans&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1491">&ldquo;Batman Returns&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d already been three <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=701">&ldquo;Lotus&rdquo;</a> games from Gremlin and now they had
signed a new, exclusive, long-term world wide agreement with the car
manufacturer. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the only release following this was <a href="http://hol.abime.net/3039">&ldquo;The
Classic Lotus Trilogy&rdquo;</a> compilation, at least for the Amiga.</p>
<p>Hardware retailers SDL and Silica were squaring off against each other with
some very attractive A1200 bundles.</p>
<p>Screenshots of a new beat&rsquo;em up with fancy ray-traced graphics were released
by Mirage. CD32 and A570 owners would be able to get their hands on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1792">&ldquo;Rise of
the Robots&rdquo;</a> before Christmas (well, assuming it wasn&rsquo;t delayed&hellip;)</p>
<p>The high street could look forward to a new games store with Future Zone
looking to open 40 locations throughout the UK by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The One recommended owners of Public Domain disks do a bit of a clean out as
the Home Affairs Commission were launching a crackdown on computer
pornography.</p>
<p>News came from Tokyo that Taito were about to start construction on a new Â£30
million theme park called Cannonball City.</p>
<p>EA were working on an upgraded version of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1355">&ldquo;Wing Commander&rdquo;</a> for the
A1200.</p>
<p>Famous C64 coder Stavros Fasoulas was working with Terramarque on a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=364">new
beat&rsquo;em up</a> that would make &ldquo;Streetfighter 2 on the Super NES look like
a Spectrum game&rdquo;, and on a regular A500 at that.</p>
<p>Joystick manufacturer Spectravideo were to release a joypad style controller,
much to the ire of The One who like a good old traditional joystick.</p>
<p>Word arrived that Dominic Diamond had quit TV show &ldquo;Gamesmaster&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month&rsquo;s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=197">&ldquo;Bubba &rsquo;n&rsquo; Stix&rdquo;</a> Core Design</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809">&ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;</a> Team 17</li>

</ul>
<p>Coverage of the launch event for &ldquo;most important development in the Amiga
range yet&rdquo;, the CD32. Chris Evans was the host and after kicking things off,
he introduced Medhi Ali (President of Commodore International) and Lew
Eggebrecht (VP of Engineering). Apparently that duo managed to dampen any
excitement with their dry presentations (which were marred by technical
glitches), causing even Evans to actually nod off. But then it was on to the
unveiling of the machine and its launch price. People approved of the price,
but the few games shown didn&rsquo;t really impress. That said, on paper the CD32
was a compelling competitor to the likes of Sega&rsquo;s Mega CD. Overall the press
reaction was positive.</p>
<p>To accompany the details of the CD32 was a round up of what the big software
companies were planning to release for it.</p>
<p>And finally, journo Simon Bryan headed down to the Virgin Games Centre in
London to ask random punters what they thought of the announcements.</p>
<p>Getting the indepth Work In Progress treatment this month were:</p>

<p>In what seems like a recurring feature now, The One asked &ldquo;Where are you&hellip;&rdquo;
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1485">&ldquo;Ambermoon&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2873">&ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo;</a> ?</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a> dev diary saw Andreas ripping the
scrolling routine out of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1023">&ldquo;Superfrog&rdquo;</a> &amp; digging into AGA, Rico buying a
scanner and Martyn buggering off to Greece for a 2 week vacation and then
lamenting the fact that he was no longer on vacation.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1236">&ldquo;Soccer Kid&rdquo;</a> Krisalis - 93% &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been so excited by a game for ages and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll share my enthusiasm when you play it. Soccer Kid is, to put it simply, in a class of its own.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1771">&ldquo;Mean Arenas&rdquo;</a> ICE - 81% &ldquo;Despite the slightly iffy graphics there&rsquo;s not really a lot to fault with Mean Arenas - while breaking no barriers in originality, it manages to combine a number of game ideas to make a surprisingly addictive and enjoyable game that I found myself coming back to time and time again.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=822">&ldquo;The Patrician&rdquo;</a> Ascon - 82% &ldquo;This has been an enormous hit in Germany for quite some while now and though I&rsquo;m not sure if people will really take an interest in the historical elements of the game, this is a deep and competitive game offering an excellent number of &lsquo;sub games&rsquo; that keep it from being repetitive.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1459">&ldquo;Premier Manager 2&rdquo;</a> Gremlin - 90% &ldquo;This really is the best bits of all the footy games bundled together and laid out on a golden plate for you, so pick a team, put your managerial hat on and assume that &lsquo;hunched over the keyboard for hours&rsquo; position that all true management game players have. Good stuff.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1157">&ldquo;Yo! Joe!&rdquo;</a> Play Byte - 84% &ldquo;Yo! Joe! may not have the polish or finesse of Soccer Kid or Flashback but as long as you&rsquo;re prepared to spend some quality time from the start then you&rsquo;ll not be disappointed. Trust me on this.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1198">&ldquo;Hired Guns&rdquo;</a> DMA Design/Psygnosis - 91% &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one game which is likely to alter the perception of RPGs then Hired Guns is it. If you usually shy away from adventuring then you need only spend a couple of minutes with DMA&rsquo;s RPG to see that this is something truly excellent.&rdquo;</li>
