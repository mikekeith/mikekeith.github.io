<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Renegade&rsquo;s release schedule was looking rather impressive with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1101">“Uridium
2”</a> first up, followed soon after by <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1082">“Turrican 3”</a> and
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=364">“Elfmania”</a>. If that wasn’t enough, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=920">“Ruff ‘n’ Tumble”</a>,
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">“Sensible World of Soccer”</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=415">“Flight of the Amazon Queen”</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(video_game">“Z”</a>) were all due by the end of the year. The last one - a real time
strategy game from the Bitmap Brothers - was particularly interesting since
it’d be years before it saw the light of day.</p>
<p>Food company Birds Eye commissioned a survey to find out how kids preferred to
spend their spare time. Given that gaming was still very much considered the
niche hobby of spods, 37% listed it as their favourite activity compared to
32% for reading&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.abime.net/2776">“Graham Gooch’s 2nd Innings”</a> was a data disk for the original game
that provided tougher opponents, 18 county teams, more stats and various other
improvements.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been a great year for Microprose which resulted in the decision to
close their Manchester and Leeds offices (the latter was formerly the home of
Vektor Grafix). They had also laid off 50 people, while consolidating others
in a new Chipping Sudbury office.</p>
<p>Old school hippy musician Steve Hillage had signed a deal with Storm to
provide the soundtrack of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawnmower_Man_(video_game)">“The Lawnmover Man”</a> CD-ROM game.</p>
<p>High street games shop Future Zone announced a new loyalty scheme where
returning customers could earn free games.</p>
<p>A new expansion board for the A1200 from AmiTek would provide up to 8 megs of
RAM, a 68882 maths co-processor and a battery backed clock for about £80.</p>
<p>Daze Marketing launched a budget line of games for £2.99.</p>
<p>The One had to make a clarification concerning <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2047">“Trex Warrior”</a> which
had featured on its cover disks a couple of months ago. It turned out the game
was only Public Domain in the UK, and subject to copyright restrictions
elsewhere. Whups.</p>
<p>EA were getting into arcade machines, though there was no word on what titles
were going to make the jump from home computers &amp; consoles.</p>
<p>Channel 4 were to release a “Gamesmaster” book to tide fans over as they
waited for the next series.</p>
<p>Commodore had earmarked £7,000,000 for CD32 advertising in the run up to
Christmas. Most of this would be spent on an “eye-popping” TV campaign.</p>
<p>Founded by ex-Amiga games journos, Binary Asylum’s first game would be
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1165">“Zeewolf”</a>.</p>
<p>ICL had taken over the contract to provide customer care to new Amiga owners
from Wang.</p>
<p>Mindscape were throwing its hat into the CD32 ring with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=752">“D/Generation”</a>
and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=568">“Alfred Chicken”</a> getting ports, and a new major CD release in the
form of Tony Crowther’s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=754">“Liberation - Captive 2”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month’s 2 cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1334">“Space Hulk”</a> Electronic Arts</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2503">“Alfred Chicken”</a> Mindscape</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2325">“Burning Rubber”</a> Ocean</li>
</ul>
<p>It was time for the Autumn ECTS show and Gary Penn provided a detailed report.
While there was a fair number of new games for the Amiga - particularly A1200
and CD32 - there were troubling signs the major software houses like EA were
beginning to focus solely on consoles and PC.</p>
<p>Getting the in-depth Work In Progress treatment this month were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=763">“Mortal Kombat”</a> Virgin</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2006">“Dreamweb”</a> Creative Reality/Empire</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=364">“Elfmania”</a> Terramarque/Renegade</li>

<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1567">“F1”</a> Lankhor/Domark</li>
</ul>
<p>The PD games reviewed were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/6260">&ldquo;Megaball&rdquo;</a> 81%</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4574">&ldquo;Zombie Massacre&rdquo;</a> 81%</li>

<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5901">&ldquo;Insectoids 2&rdquo;</a> 89%</li>
<li>&ldquo;Super Pong&rdquo; 69%</li>
</ul>
<p>In this month&rsquo;s installment of the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a> developer diary
Andreas was improving the AI and INTEX computer system, Rico was building out
the levels and ray tracing turrets, Allister was making squelching sounds and
improving the speech samples, and Martyn&hellip; well, he was laid up in bed all
month due to a &ldquo;mystery bug&rdquo; (and definitely not as a result of boozing it up
at ECTS).</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2425">“Magic Boy”</a> Empire</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=453">“Globdule”</a> Psygnosis</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/3549">“Jack the Ripper”</a> Mindscape (unreleased)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1138">“Wiz &amp; Liz”</a> Psygnosis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1334">&ldquo;Space Hulk&rdquo;</a> Nick Wilson/EA - 91% &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known a game that&rsquo;s as successful as Space Hulk at generating this level of genuinely sweaty, tense atmosphere and delivering such effective frights and scares - the game should come with an &lsquo;18&rsquo; certificate!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=182">&ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s Bad Day&rdquo;</a> The Dome/Psygnosis - 80% &ldquo;Rivalled only by the ball from Pinball Fantasies, Bob is one of the most realistic spherical objects you&rsquo;ll find on the Amiga, with the twisty-turny platforms conveying a genuine sense of vertigo as you teeter over the edge of a cog-infested chasm with only the pull of gravity preventing you from loosing valuable coins.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=169">&ldquo;Blastar&rdquo;</a> Core Design - 81% &ldquo;Probably Blastar&rsquo;s best feature is the sheer variety in the gameplay. In almost every level the playing style chops and changes, keeping you on your toes with a new challenge.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=321">&ldquo;Disposable Hero&rdquo;</a> Euphoria/Gremlin - 83% &ldquo;On the one hand it&rsquo;s a fast-paced rocket ride, generally following traditional lines but spiced up in places with a few modern touches and some stunning sprites. Or, on the other, you could say it&rsquo;s a sadly dated format that was found, conquered and left by the roadside long ago in preference to games that require just a little more than a fast trigger finger, such as Syndicate.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2099">&ldquo;Overkill&rdquo;</a> DigiSoft/Mindscape - 89% &ldquo;Now this is really something: Overkill is one helluva blast. It&rsquo;s immediately pickupable and just the kind of game that you can play for either hours on end or a few minutes at a time, depending on what mood you&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2534">&ldquo;Gear Works&rdquo;</a> Hollyware Entertainment/Software Business - 84% &ldquo;The difficulty curve is perfect, gradually introducing you to more aspects of the gameplay as you go and slowly making the play areas that bit more awkward to get around.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2503">&ldquo;Alfred Chicken&rdquo;</a> Twilight/Mindscape - 86% &ldquo;Alfred Chicken is concrete proof that you don&rsquo;t need flashy graphics, parallax scrolling and 16.8 million colours to end up with a superbly playable platformer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=743">&ldquo;Micro Machines&rdquo;</a> Codemasters - 89% &ldquo;When we got a demo of this game a month or so ago we spent a rather frightening amount of time playing it. It even got to the point where Sensi Soccer was demoted to second fiddle as far as lunchtime challenges were concerned.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392">&ldquo;F17 Challenge&rdquo;</a> Holodream/Team 17 - 84% &ldquo;As you&rsquo;d expect from Team 17, F17 Challenge is a quality game with loads of neat touches.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=615">&ldquo;Jurassic Park&rdquo;</a> Ocean - 89% &ldquo;Graphically it&rsquo;s a real treat; the Chaos Engine-y top-viewed sections move very smoothly even when there&rsquo;s a vast number of dinosaurs milling about and the 3D sections are detailed and move smoothly.&rdquo;</li>
