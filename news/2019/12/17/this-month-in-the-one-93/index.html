<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Editor David Upchurch had “deserted” the mag for a couple of months which left
Simon Byron in charge.</p>
<p>The CD32 received some encouraging news as high street retailer Menzies
announced they would be stocking it in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>After some months of silence (on the Amiga at any rate), Thalamus was about to release <a href="http://hol.abime.net/2163">“S.U.B.”</a> (unreleased). The One wondered what had happened to <a href="http://hol.abime.net/3529">“Arsenal”</a> - rumour was the programmer had gone missing&hellip; It wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day.</p>
<p>Domark had found considerable success with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1842">“Championship Manager ‘93”</a>
so it was no surprise they were readying a <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1843">data disk for ‘94</a>. As an
aside, The One pointed out that six out of the top ten Amiga games were footie
related.</p>
<p>There were few details, but Psygnosis provided some screenshots of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=90">“Armageddon 2”</a> and a mystery isometric game similar in style to
various Spectrum titles (but a lot more colourful, obv).</p>
<p>Apparently “Lawnmower Man” was the “most successful British film for 20
years”, at least according to Storm boss Jane Cavanagh. A CD32 version of the
game tie in was planned (but never released), and a sequel to the movie was
also in the works. Storm were expanding with a new Southampton office
dedicated to CD games, and a Santa Monica office which had signed a deal with
Sony.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers were about to be the proud owners of the two largest
video walls in Europe. Each wall featured 256 screens which were powered by an
Amiga setup developed by CD Interactive Ltd.</p>
<p>As a promotion for their upcoming <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1137">“Winter Games”</a>, US Gold published
a&hellip; bunch of facts about the Winter Olympics&hellip;</p>
<p>Interplay were to throw in a video tape of “Star Trek - The Motion Picture”
with the first batch of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2873">“Star Trek: The 25th Anniversary”</a>.</p>
<p>“Craft 1” was an add on package for AMOS from Black Legend which included a
new audio system, Julia and Mandelbrot fractal sets amongst other things.</p>
<p>In a move that surprised most people, Virgin sold all of its Game Centres to
competitor Future Zone. This follows on the heels of Branson selling Virgin
Records, Virgin Mastertronic and a chunk of Virgin Interactive.</p>
<p>CD32 enhanced versions of Gremlin’s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=577">“Zool”</a> and <a href="http://hol.abime.net/3039">“The Lotus
Trilogy”</a> were on their way. The latter would feature all three Lotus
games on one CD, with new graphics and a new soundtrack.</p>
<p>The One was rather snarky when it came to reporting on a new game from Hot
Shot Entertainment called <a href="http://hol.abime.net/4772">“Rocket Rescue”</a> because it was promoted as
new and innovative when it all looked rather old hat. It was not released.</p>
<p>A new joystick from Spectravideo and Logic 3 boasted nine micro switches, five
fire buttons, auto fire and an extra long cable.</p>
<p>The Etching Transfer Company were offering a new service to etch identifying
words into your monitor to put off thieves, or something.</p>
<p>Tabloid The Sun’s game <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2884">“Snapperazzi”</a> had found a publisher in
Alternative and would sell for £19.95.</p>
<p>Psygnosis was to publish “Discworld” by Teeny Weeny Games, though it never
made it to the Amiga.</p>
<p>Empire released a compilation featuring its own <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1583">“Pacific Islands”</a> and
two from Microprose: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2637">“F117A”</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=962">“Silent Service II”</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=56">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a> Team 17 - 91% &ldquo;We all knew this was going to be something rather special and I&rsquo;m more than happy to report that our initial expectations have been well and truly exceeded. Once past the first level it&rsquo;s back into familiar alien-killing territory, albeit with tons of incredible sound effects, graphics and subtle gameplay variations, so fans of the first game are going to feel perfectly at home.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=828">&ldquo;Perihelion&rdquo;</a> Morbid Vision/Psygnosis - 82% &ldquo;It has an excellent style of presentation and works by an incredibly user-friendly interface, but as atmospheric as Perihelion&rsquo;s setting, sound and graphics are, the game itself leaves a bit to be desired in a few areas.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=184">&ldquo;Body Blows Galactic&rdquo;</a> Team 17 - 87% &ldquo;Compared to the original it goes far and beyond it thanks to the strange nature of the opponents. Add to that the eight-player tournament and you&rsquo;ve got a game that&rsquo;s perfectly competent in all departments and is just about the best beat-&rsquo;em-up available for the Amiga.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2637">&ldquo;F-117A Stealth Fighter&rdquo;</a> Microprose - 80% &ldquo;What I can say is that there’s little difference between flying this baby and flying Microprose’s former sim, F-15 Strike Eagle II, and I think I’d be pretty safe in guessing that the real planes don’t behave in the same way.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2873">“Star Trek”</a> Interplay - 83% “This is a must for anyone who finds themselves strangely drawn towards things vaguely Star Trek related. The interface is excellent, making everything instantly accessible and leaving you with no worries when it comes to selecting the right object, chat-up line or which phaser to shoot.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=998">“Stardust”</a> Bloodhouse/Daze - 91% “Stardust may look pretty from the screenshots but you’ve got to see it running to really appreciate how beautiful it is - the animation is outstanding and everything moves sooo smoothly. I’ve no idea how they did it but - by God! - I’m glad they did.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=453">“Globdule”</a> Ex Animo Design/Psygnosis - 82% “At last - a platform game (or ‘splatform’, as Psygnosis are touting it) with a degree of originality. How refreshing it is to not have to hit secret blocks to reveal bonuses, or meander along horizontally-scrolling levels merely jumping on heads.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=934">“Second Samurai”</a> Vivid Image Design/Psygnosis - 87% “When you first load up Second Samurai you’d be forgiven for thinking that Psyggy had pulled a fast one and slipped you a copy of First Samurai in a different box. Specifically the two games appear very similar; despite the nice parallax backdrops, the graphics have a slightly dated look (circa 1989, I’d say), the sound appears to have been transplanted straight across to the sequel and the gameplay is just more hacking-‘n’-slashing mayhem.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1032">“The Settlers”</a> Blue Byte - 90% “To put it succinctly, The Settlers is one of the most impressive games ever to have come out of Germany. Or anywhere else for that matter. It’s been a while since I’ve played a strategy game for as long as I spent on The Settlers.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=215">“Cannon Fodder”</a> Sensible Software/Virgin Interactive - 93% “Brilliance. Sheer, unadulterated brilliance. Cannon Fodder is quite simply one of the best strategy/action/shoot-‘em-ups to appear for ages.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1141">“Wonder Dog”</a> Core Design - 84% “Okay, Wonder Dog is nothing new. The only revolutionary thing about is that you can’t kill the baddies by jumping on their heads, which has to be something of an innovation for a platform game these days. So why has it been rated so highly? Well, for starters it’s supremely playable.”</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=754">“Liberation: Captive 2”</a> Byte Engineers/Mindscape - 94% “Thank God - game that finally does the CD32 justice. The simple fact of the matter is that Liberation is quite possibly the best game I’ve ever played - it’s so good it makes Frontier look like a PD text adventure.”</li>
