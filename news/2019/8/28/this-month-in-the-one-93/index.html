<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>A year after announcing they were leaving the Amiga behind, news arrived that
Sierra On-Line were bringing <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1275">&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Quest VI&rdquo;</a> to our beloved machine.
The conversion was being handled by Charles Cecil&rsquo;s Revolution which had
created a hybrid of its &ldquo;Virtual Theatre&rdquo; system for the job to ensure the
game felt at home on the system, rather than some shoddy PC port.</p>
<p>Krisalis spawned a new sub-label, Buzz, as home for its back catalogue.</p>
<p>Footie club Chelsea slightly tweaked their shirts this season with an Amiga
logo replacing the Commodore. The One phoned their marketing department for
more info and apparently confused the person on the other end of the line who
hadn&rsquo;t heard of Amiga.</p>
<p>Kiwi developer Acid Software house were working on top down off road
racer<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3122">&ldquo;Skidmarks&rdquo;</a>. Meanwhile, fellow NZ devs Vision Software (who
shared the same business address as Acid&hellip;) announced <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=937">&ldquo;Seek &amp;
Destroy&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Alternative Software had signed some new licenses, the first two being the
rather odd choices of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2233">&ldquo;Hulk Hogan&rsquo;s Suburban Commando&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1288">&quot;&lsquo;Allo
&lsquo;Allo Cartoon Fun&quot;</a>. They also had a few more budget titles on the way.</p>
<p>Music and film merch company Outer Limits were expanding to games with a new
line of 13 tshirts featuring the likes of &ldquo;Street Fighter II&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lemmings&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Zool&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a somewhat surprising move, Spectrum Holobyte swallowed up Microprose in a
$10 million deal. Despite the latter&rsquo;s large catalogue, it appeared they
didn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of cash in the bank. While the UK office was to be
unaffected, long standing Microprose chairman &ldquo;Wild Bill&rdquo; Stealey stood down.</p>
<p>Computer retailer Silica had an offer for an A600 pack which included a 20mb
hard drive, three games and a software bundle for £299.</p>
<p>The One were unsure what to think following them taking the award for &ldquo;Most
Improved Publication&rdquo; at EMAP&rsquo;s own awards ceremony.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=415">&ldquo;Flight of the Amazon Queen&rdquo;</a> was to be the first title from Renegade&rsquo;s
new signing, aussies Binary Design. Renegade were also throwing their hat into
what seemed to be an increasingly crowded ring of software houses creating
phone in/interactive TV versions of games by doing a deal with Triton.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Domark weren&rsquo;t impressed with Team 17&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;F1&rdquo; in their
upcoming racer&rsquo;s title (<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392">&ldquo;F1 Challenge&rdquo;</a>), which was now being renamed.</p>
<p>In a move that caused a little concern in the Amiga community, UK retailer
John Menzies had decided to drop Amiga hardware.</p>
<p>Psygnosis had a summer special on with a slew of their games dropping to 15
quid.</p>
<p>In a sign that games were gaining greater acceptance, ITV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Movies, Movies,
Movies&rdquo; show was changing to be &ldquo;Movies, Games, and Videos&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4442">&ldquo;Blues Brothers Juke Box Adventure&rdquo;</a> was to be the sequel to last
year&rsquo;s hit game. Titus promised something &ldquo;similar to the original, but a lot
better&rdquo;. Alrighty then. Unreleased.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t come as much of a surprise that US Gold&rsquo;s home computer port of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1007">&ldquo;Street Fighter II&rdquo;</a> had sold like gang busters, racking up an
impressive 125,000 sales throughout Europe (unclear whether that figure was
just for the Amiga version).</p>

<p>On this month&rsquo;s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2047">&ldquo;Trex Warrior&rdquo;</a> Thalion</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=584">&ldquo;Ishar 2&rdquo;</a> Silmarils (demo)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2609">&ldquo;Wibble World Giddy&rdquo;</a> Public Domain</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3796">&ldquo;Snakes&rdquo;</a> Shareware</li>
</ul>
<p>The long rumoured CD32 was finally revealed! The One took a look at the specs
and talked to a few industry folk for their reactions. The overall sentiment
was very positive: a more powerful bit of kit than the MegaCD and at a lower
price (£299)&hellip; but of course the big question was: would software houses be
jumping in to support it?</p>
<p>A review roundup of games based on Arnie films, with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=896">&ldquo;Red Heat&rdquo;</a>
narrowly winning with a passable 7/10.</p>
<p>The games getting the Work In Progress treatment this month were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1667">&ldquo;Beneath a Steel Sky&rdquo;</a> Revolution Software/Virgin</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/1367">&ldquo;TFX&rdquo;</a> Digital Image Design/Ocean</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3105">&ldquo;Total Carnage&rdquo;</a> Ice</li>
<li>&ldquo;Utopia 2&rdquo; Gremlin Graphics (unreleased?)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=196">&ldquo;Brutal Sports Football&rdquo;</a> Teque/Millennium</li>
</ul>
<p>A &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; article where The One hunted down two games that were meant
to have been finished ages ago: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1101">&ldquo;Uridium 2&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=306">&ldquo;Darkmere&rdquo;</a>. In
the case of the former, the constantly changing background graphics were to
blame, while with &ldquo;Darkmere&rdquo; it seemed the original team had been a tad over
optimistic about what they could do with the Amiga and had been taken off the
project.</p>
<p>The third instalment of the <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a> dev diary saw Rico working
on the 32-colour graphics, Andreas wrap up the budget release of
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=866">&ldquo;Project-X&rdquo;</a>, Allister visit the zoo with a DAT recorder to sample some
animals and Martyn try to lower peoples expectations of the A1200 version.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2623">&ldquo;Deep Core&rdquo;</a> Dynafield Systems/ICE - 81% &ldquo;But for a game which isn&rsquo;t mind-blowingly original it just seems to hang together admirably and provides a pretty tough experience which most arcade fans will lap up.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1097">&ldquo;Universal Warrior&rdquo;</a> Zeppelin Platinum - 80% &ldquo;This is lovely and simple and the perfect sort of thing to put on the budget market. It&rsquo;s perfect for a quick five minute romp but stands up well if you want to spend time building yourself a wonder-droid.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1570">&ldquo;Galactic Warrior Rats&rdquo;</a> Mikev Designs/Alternative - 80% &ldquo;Although Universal Warrior and Galactic Warrior Rats obviously look and sound different, in terms of gameplay there&rsquo;s not a lot to choose between them. If I had to pick one as the superior game then I&rsquo;d have to say that Rats has the slight advantage, simply because it looks and sounds a lot nicer.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=145">&ldquo;Beastlord&rdquo;</a> WJS Design/Grandslam - 80% &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect anything original to appear on your screen when you load this up, but I suppose that we haven&rsquo;t had a decent game of this type for a while so you may find it fills a gap.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5164">&ldquo;Campaign: From North Africa to Northern Europe&rdquo;</a> Jonathan Griffiths/Empire - 80% &ldquo;Overall I think that this is an excellent add-on if you already love the game and will keep you amused for quite some time - and in all honesty I can&rsquo;t think what else you could do to enhance this type of game other than give more variety to the player.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/67">&ldquo;Battle Isle &lsquo;93&rdquo;</a> Blue Byte - 89% &ldquo;However, don&rsquo;t play this if you have no patience, because each game is going to need your full attention for a fair amount of time and there is no facility to save the game halfway through - a major grumble with a game that can take so long to complete at higher levels.&rdquo;</li>
