            <p>Since my last update work has been a bit quieter post-ship and I enjoyed an
unexpectedly low key Christmas break, so surely I&rsquo;ve made a lot of progress,
right? Well&hellip; life decided to intervene which resulted in a lot less time to
work on the game than I had hoped. But I have managed to tick off a few things
on the long to-do list&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-02-24-2019224diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/image-asset.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="item-activation">Item Activation</h2>
<p>The main - and, I must admit, only - playing facing addition is items that
need to be activated before they can be matched. Activation occurs when a
neighbour - regardless of colour - is matched and removed. I&rsquo;ve reserved the
4th bit to indicate whether an item requires activation, which means I have 7
possible item types. So far I&rsquo;m only using 4, so I <em>think</em> this will be
enough. However, I should be able to take the 5th bit to give 15 item types
(each with an unactivated variant) if need be.</p>
<p>The item bits at present are:</p>
<pre><code>.const ITEM_TYPE_BITS = %00001111
.const ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION = %00001000
.const ITEM_MOVING = %00100000
.const ITEM_DONT_DRAW = %01000000

.enum {
    ITEM_TYPE_NONE = 0,
    ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL = 1,
    ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL = 2,
    ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL = 3,
    ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL = 4,

    ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_1 = 5,
    ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_2 = 6,
    ITEM_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER_3 = 7,

    ITEM_TYPE_NONE_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_NONE + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION,

    ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_WHITE_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION,
    ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_RED_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION,
    ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL_UNACTIVATED = ITEM_TYPE_CYAN_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION,
    ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL_UNACTIVATED =ITEM_TYPE_PURPLE_BALL + ITEM_AWAITING_ACTIVATION,


    ITEM_NUM_TYPES = 13
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h2>
<p>Up until a couple of months ago, the code to handle the sprite movement when
the player fires an item was specific to that use case. Rather than having
items jump immediately to their new positions when neighbours are removed, I
want to utilise this sprite iterpolation to make it nice and smooth. So the
first step in the process was to refactor the code into something more
generic.</p>
<p>The resulting routines are super simplistic - the interpolation speeds are
specified as pixels per update (whole pixels only), and the X and Y
coordinates are interpolated at the same speed, which doesn&rsquo;t look great under
some circumstances. I may revisit this in the future.</p>
<p>The following clip shows this code in action:</p>
<pre><code>test_lerp:
    :test_push_lerp(0, 0, 100, 200, 1)
    :test_push_lerp(200, 0, 50, 200, 2)
    :test_push_lerp(20, 0, 70, 200, 3)
    :test_push_lerp(60, 0, 40, 200, 4)
    :test_push_lerp(90, 0, 120, 200, 5)
    :test_push_lerp(0, 0, 100, 200, 1)
    :test_push_lerp(200, 0, 50, 200, 2)
    :test_push_lerp(20, 0, 70, 200, 3)
    :test_push_lerp(60, 0, 40, 200, 4)
    :test_push_lerp(90, 0, 120, 200, 5)

!loop:
    :start_frame_update(1, !profiling)
    jsr item_lerper.tick
</code></pre>
<p>where the test_push_lerp parameters are the start X &amp; Y, target X &amp; Y and
colour.</p>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
<p>While writing the activation and interpolation code, I ran into two separate
bugs that had me scatching my head for an embarassingly long time.</p>
<p>The first occurred when matched items were being removed - occasionally the
bottom left item would disappear when it shouldn&rsquo;t. I suspected this had
something to do with the new code which finds any neighbours of an item being
removed and activates them. The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger/">64 Debugger</a> was a huge help in
tracking the culprit down, especially since it recently added the ability to
read KickAssembler debug symbols. This is brilliant as it gives you your full
source code along side the instructions:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-02-24-2019224diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/Capto_Capture-2019-02-24_11-09-42_AM.png" alt="Capto_Capture 2019-02-24_11-09-42_AM.png"></p>
<p><img src="/images/2019-02-24-2019224diary-of-a-game-part-4-item-activation-interpolation-and-bugs/Capto_Capture-2019-02-24_11-11-43_AM.png" alt="Capto_Capture 2019-02-24_11-11-43_AM.png"></p>
<p>Sure enough the bug was in the routine to find occupied neighbours - if there
were no neighbours, I was neglecting to set the count of neighbours found to
zero. This meant it would try to activate whatever items happened to be lying
around in a buffer.</p>
<p>The second bug was considerably harder to find&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-perils-of-macros">The Perils of Macros</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/webhelp/content/cpt_Introduction.html">KickAssembler</a> has a rich scripting language to assist with creating
code and data. For my first pass on the interpolation routines, I relied
heavily on the scripting - particularly macros and pseudocommands. This made
things like operating over a buffer of data structures very straightforward,
for example:</p>
<pre><code>.for (var i = 0; i &lt; lerping_items_count; i++) {
    lda lerping_items[i].active
    beq !skip+

    :lerp(lerping_items[i].current_x, lerping_items[i].target_x, ITEM_DROP_SPEED, lerping_items[i].active)
    :lerp(lerping_items[i].current_y, lerping_items[i].target_y, ITEM_DROP_SPEED, lerping_items[i].active)

    :update_lerping_item_sprite(i)
    ....
</code></pre>
<p>But then I ran into a bug where some interpolating items would just disappear
when a certain number had been queued. What made this particularly difficult
to debug was the reliance on macros and pseudocommands. Because I was calling
several macros, which in turn called other macros and pseudocommands, and all
of this was wrapped in a for loop, the amount of actual code output was huge.
I found stepping through all this code tedious and confusing - particularly
since the issue only appeared towards the end of the interpolating items
buffer.</p>
<p>The cause turned out to be a classic mixup between an address and the size of
a buffer. In the routine to find a free interpolating item to use, I loop over
all the items in the buffer to see if there is one that isn&rsquo;t active:</p>
<pre><code>get_free_lerping_item_offset:
    ldx #0
!loop:    
    lda lerping_items,X
    beq !found_free+

    txa
    clc    
    adc #lerping_item_size()
    cmp #lerping_items_end  // &lt;---- d'oh
    bcs !none_free+

    tax
    jmp !loop-
!found_free:
    rts
!none_free:
    ldx #255
    rts
</code></pre>
<p>lerping_items_end happens to be the memory <em>address</em> immediately after the
lerping items buffer. What I wanted, of course, was to compare the current
offset to the <em>size</em> of the buffer.</p>
<h2 id="kickassembler-5">KickAssembler 5</h2>
<p>As well as the ability to output full symbols/source for use in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/c64-debugger">C64
Debugger</a>, there are a number of other <a href="http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#updates">nice improvements</a> in
KickAssembler 5. However, the changes to escape characters in strings broke
the useful unit test framework <a href="https://github.com/64bites/64spec">64spec</a>. I&rsquo;ve submitted a <a href="https://github.com/64bites/64spec/pull/4">pull
request</a> that fixes these errors.</p>
