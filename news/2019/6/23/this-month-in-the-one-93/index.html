<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>The Amiga had a strong showing at this year&rsquo;s Golden Joysticks awards. Team 17
and Sensible Software won Software House of the Year and Computer Game of the
Year respectively, with Jon Hare giving a &ldquo;stirring speech warning against the
dangers of complacency.&rdquo; The Amiga related winners were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software House of the Year: Team 17</li>
<li>Computer Game of the Year: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=941">&ldquo;Sensible Soccer&rdquo;</a> Sensible Software</li>
<li>Best Licensed Computer Game: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=558">&ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&rdquo;</a> LucasArts</li>
<li>Programming Team of the Year: LucasArts</li>
<li>Best Computer Simulation: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=389">&ldquo;Formula One Grand Prix&rdquo;</a> Geoff Crammond/Microprose</li>
</ul>
<p>Team 17 announced two new titles, both racing games: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=809">&ldquo;Overdrive&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=392">&ldquo;F1 Challenge&rdquo;</a> (the latter would be renamed to &ldquo;F17 Challenge&rdquo; after some legal issues). They had also signed Jose Doran and Richard Heasman who were working on a game code named &ldquo;Little Sod&rdquo;: &ldquo;Lots of humour is promised, as the game will present its player with 99 ways to splat an inoffensive little blue blob.&rdquo; I have no idea if that ever saw the light of day. Martyn Brown also teased a future project with a Swedish developer who was known for pinball&hellip; So obviously Digitial Illusions, but did anything actually come of this?</p>
<p>Virgin was to bring several of Acclaim&rsquo;s big name license titles to the Amiga:
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1046">&ldquo;Terminator 2: The Coin-Op&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=54">&ldquo;Alien 3&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2127">&ldquo;The Crash
Dummies&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=125">&ldquo;The Simpsons: Bart Vs the World&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1579">&ldquo;Krusty&rsquo;s Fun
House&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=763">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat&rdquo;</a>. They were due out in time for
Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knightmare&rdquo; TV production company Broadsword was teaming up with Mindscape to
bring a higher quality series of &ldquo;interactive broadcast&rdquo; games (similar to the
ones already on kids TV shows where contestants sent input to the games over
the phone). If they proved successful then they might make their way to the
Amiga.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Street Fighter II&rdquo; pinball table was heading to arcades courtesy of
Gottlieb.</p>
<p>Already a hit in Japan, Tomy&rsquo;s new handheld, the Barcode Battler, was coming
to the UK. It was an interesting concept - standard consumer product barcodes
could be scanned to supply extra &ldquo;power&rdquo; to the game - but in reality it
wasn&rsquo;t up to much.</p>
<p>The TV show &ldquo;Bad Influence&rdquo; had been picked up for a second series.</p>
<p>Hot on the heel&rsquo;s of its collaboration with H.R. Giger, Cyberdreams announced
a new game in conjunction with &ldquo;Bladerunner&rdquo; designer Syd Mead.
<a href="http://hol.abime.net/2930">&ldquo;CyberRace&rdquo;</a> was to be a 3D combat and racing game developed by their
recently opened European office. It was not released.</p>
<p>Gremlin had signed the game licence of recently reformed band Madness, who
were apparently &ldquo;really involved&rdquo; with the development (I&rsquo;ve no idea what that
was). There was also word that <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1169">&ldquo;Zool II&rdquo;</a> was aiming for an October
release.</p>
<p>After less than 12 months in the job, Commodore UK managing director Kelly
Sumner left to head up the European office of GameTek. Replacing him were
David Pleasance and Colin Proudfoot.</p>
<p>The European Leisure Software Publishers Association enlisted the help of MP
Emma Nicholson in the fight against piracy.</p>
<p>James Pond would soon get his own comic strip in kids mag &ldquo;Look In!&rdquo;, along
with a line of t-shirts.</p>
<p>There was a new Flight Sim fanzine (&ldquo;The Computer Flight Sim Journal&rdquo;) being
published in Australia.</p>
<p>Psygnosis won a Queen&rsquo;s Award for Export, which was apparently a big deal as
they were the first software house to do so. This was down to them releasing
their games in Japan.</p>
<p>Domark launched a sports sims label called Champions of Sport.</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to build a model kit and then, well, play a computer game
featuring the resulting vehicle the Revell had a new range of products for
you. The first instalment was to be &ldquo;Motor Stars&rdquo; which included a collection
of exotic cars.</p>
<p>Digital Image Design signed an impressive 6 game deal with Ocean and the first
title was to be &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; (unreleased?).</p>
<p>The One got a sneak peak at Bloodhouse&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=998">&ldquo;Stardust&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>A new book offered hints and help for over 300 Amiga games. The &ldquo;Amiga Gamer&rsquo;s
Guide (Volume One)&rdquo; included games like &ldquo;Street Fighter 2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Robocod&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blues
Brothers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Zool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Another World&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zak McKracken&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Winter Olympics were to take place in Lillehammer in February and US Gold
hoped to rule the charts with their game based on the event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2516">&ldquo;Out to Lunch&rdquo;</a> was to be the next game from Mindscape, with <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1817">&ldquo;Sim
Life&rdquo;</a> soon after.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>On this month&rsquo;s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1440">&ldquo;Nippon Safes Inc.&rdquo;</a> DMI</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3666">&ldquo;Blaster&rdquo;</a> PD</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3172">&ldquo;Alien Bash&rdquo;</a> PD</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/5914">&ldquo;Tractor Beam&rdquo;</a> PD</li>
</ul>
<p>An interview with Bob Wade, Andy Wilton and Andy Smith from Asylum.</p>
<p>A large feature titled &ldquo;In the Biz&rdquo; which focussed on getting a job in the
industry. The One sent copies of PD game <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3666">&ldquo;Blaster&rdquo;</a> along with a letter
signed by a made up person asking for feedback to a bunch of publishers (I
assume they got the programmer&rsquo;s permission). They received a variety of
responses, some flat out rejections, others offering interviews for positions.
The article finished with a series of interviews with industry folk.</p>
<p>The games getting the Work In Progress treatment this month were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=197">&ldquo;Bubba &rsquo;n&rsquo; Stix&rdquo;</a> Core Design</li>
<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4443">&ldquo;Realms of Darkness&rdquo;</a> Grandslam (unreleased)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1414">&ldquo;Innocent - Until Caught&rdquo;</a> Psygnosis</li>

<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/2376">&ldquo;Maelstrom&rdquo;</a> Empire</li>

<p>There was the first instalment of Team 17&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2158">&ldquo;Alien Breed 2&rdquo;</a>
development diary which mainly consisted of a drunken ECTS (including beers
with Digital Illusions at an Islington pub), numerous hardware issues/failures
and even some work on the new level editor.</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=934">&ldquo;Second Samurai&rdquo;</a> Psygnosis</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=237">&ldquo;The Cartoons&rdquo;</a> Loricel</li>

<li><a href="http://hol.abime.net/4405">&ldquo;Creepers&rdquo;</a> Empire (unreleased)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1408">&ldquo;Goal!&rdquo;</a> Dino Dini/Virgin - 91% &ldquo;Whichever way you look at it, Goal! is one hell of a game and brilliant fun to play but I&rsquo;m feel [sic] that the office favourite will, perhaps unfairly, remain Sensible Soccer - mainly because it&rsquo;s easier for novices to grasp.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=666">&ldquo;Worlds Of Legend - Son of the Empire&rdquo;</a> Mindscape - 89% &ldquo;Legend devotees, however, will need no encouragement to rush out and get this as soon as poss, and very sensible of them too. One day all RPGs will be made this way&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=699">&ldquo;The Lost Vikings&rdquo;</a> Interplay - 90% &ldquo;I love this game. It&rsquo;s got more charm than Roger Moore wearing a lucky pendant bracelet. The way the three Vikings gripe with each other is hilarious and this, along with the excellent animation, gives them real character, making the task of getting through each level all the more enjoyable and addictive - as if this game wasn&rsquo;t addictive enough already!&rdquo;</li>
