<h3 id="sensible-softwareocean-1986">Sensible Software/Ocean, 1986</h3>
<p>This month in 1986 saw Sensible&rsquo;s first big title reviewed in Zzap!64, scoring
a very respectable 93% overall and receiving a Sizzler.</p>
<p>Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve tried to remember where I first saw &ldquo;Parallax&rdquo;&hellip;
I want to say it was at my friend Neil&rsquo;s house, but did he even have a C64?? I
know he had a Spectrum and later an Amiga&hellip; Maybe it was someone else.. I&rsquo;m
certain that whoever it was owned an actual legit original, on disk no less
(I, like most of my friends, was stuck with cassettes). I seem to recall the
friend raving about it, loading it up to show me only to watch my rather
unimpressed reaction. What was up with that weird title music?!</p>
<p>But at some point I got to spend quality time with it. The title music that I
had found weird and annoying quickly became my favourite piece of game music
ever, as it remains to this very day. It&rsquo;s incredible. I think it took Galway
a whole two weeks to write, which was considered a long time back then. Crazy.
Years later I chatted to Martin over email and it sounded like &ldquo;Parallax&rdquo; was
a turning point for him as he realised he was making music that he enjoyed
while kicking back at home, rather than music suited to computer game store
displays to attract buyers. Personally I don&rsquo;t think that was a bad thing&hellip;</p>
<p>I loved the filmic intro - I don&rsquo;t really think I had seen many examples of
that before. And I loved the fact that these Sensible blokes seemed like right
characters who liberally sprinkled humour throughout the game (also, was the
&ldquo;Your a real man now!&rdquo; grammatical error intentional??).</p>
<p>As for the game itself, well, I don&rsquo;t recall ever making it past the first
level back then. I found the whole thing quite baffling, and was more than
happy to just leave it sitting on the title screen.</p>
<p>Today I set out to rectify that. I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have the skill or patience
to get make a meaningful dent in the game, so I leant on some handy trainers.
The funny thing (well, wasn&rsquo;t quite so funny at the time) is that even with
trainers it is entirely possible to instantly die and go straight to game over
if you make the mistake of trying to progress to the next zone without having
shutdown the system first (and there is no indication that I could see that a
particular route would lead that way).</p>
<p>The game is hard. Like, really hard. The whole bouncing-your-ship-off-
buildings/barriers/etc can quickly make it feel like you&rsquo;re not in control and
therefore frustrating. And don&rsquo;t get me started about landing. The system with
the scientists and key cards was initially confusing (particularly since the
key card dropped by a scientist is random, and not specific to that spot as I
would expect) - I should&rsquo;ve spent some time up front experimenting with it
all. Or maybe read the instructions.</p>
<p>For the final steps of completing the game I admit I had to resort to double
checking a youtube video due to it not being clear where to go, with the
constant threat of a sudden unexpected game over event hanging over me.</p>
<p>Now, what happened next was astonishing&hellip; astonishing as in a bizarrely bad
and highly confusing game complete &ldquo;sequence&rdquo;. I think this may be one of the
worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I literally had to look up whether what I had just seen
was the actual end. I get the feeling Sensible just ran out of memory and/or
time.</p>
<p>At any rate, 30 years on I&rsquo;ve finally completed one of the most memorable
games I&rsquo;ve played. The game is good and worth checking out, but the music
continues to be absolutely stunning - a masterpiece, and the gold standard as
far as I&rsquo;m concerned.</p>
<p>Zzap!64 scored it:</p>
<p><strong>Presentation 94%</strong></p>
<p>Great title screen and many neat in-game features</p>
<p><strong>Graphics 82%</strong></p>
<p>Competent sprites and backdrops with effective parallax scrolling.</p>
<p><strong>Sound 93%</strong></p>
<p>Good FX and jingles, and a weird but wonderful piece of music on the title
screen.</p>
<p><strong>Hookability 90%</strong></p>
<p>The instructions need to be read, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to work out what to do
without them.</p>
<p><strong>Lastability 93%</strong></p>
<p>Tough, demanding, and very playable.</p>
<p><strong>Value For Money 92%</strong></p>
<p>A worthy buy - if you&rsquo;ve got a tenner you can still buy another copy ZZAP!
[sic] with the change.</p>
<p><strong>Overall 93%</strong></p>
<p>A neat mix between a shoot em up and an arcade adventure, with a few other
things thrown in for good measure.</p>
