<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>May 28th would see Video Charity Day take place as part of the &ldquo;massive&rdquo; &lsquo;88
Telethon charity drive. Video rental customers would be &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; to donate
while in video stores and there would be competitions and raffles.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG found the fact that the player character in Martech&rsquo;s <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1362">&ldquo;Vixen&rdquo;</a> was
female &ldquo;doubly refreshing&rdquo;. The double part may have been a reference to the
game&rsquo;s cover/advertisements which featured a photo of a Page 3 girl Corinne
Russell.</p>
<p>New from toy company Tomy was Mr DJ which was basically an AM/FM radio which
waved his arms in time with the music.</p>
<p>Anglia TV&rsquo;s innovative adventure game show &ldquo;Knightmare&rdquo; won the Jean d&rsquo;Arcy
International Award for Video Production.</p>
<p>Rainbird&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verminator&rdquo; would see the player take on the role of a pest
exterminator called into to clear out an infestation from ancient oak.
(Unclear if this was ever published)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3253">&ldquo;Sorcerer Lord&rdquo;</a> from PSS was making its way to the C64.</p>
<p>Ocean were following up <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004082">&ldquo;Renegade&rdquo;</a> with <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004087">&ldquo;Target Renegade&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>It seemed that the general feeling from the recent British Play-By-Mail
Convention was that PBM was going &ldquo;from strength to strength&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The three Spy vs Spy games were to appear on a compilation called &ldquo;The Spy
Trilogy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Atari User Show would take place at London&rsquo;s Alexandra Palace on
April 22nd through to the 24th.</p>
<p>Cascade had teamed up with the Royal Air Force on what promised to be &ldquo;the
ultimate flight simulation&rdquo; with proceeds going to the RAF Benevolent Fund.</p>
<p>Super Soft&rsquo;s adventure game based on the &ldquo;Lone Wolf&rdquo; series of role playing
books had been delayed until autumn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blissbreak&rdquo; from Outlaw would be like pool and snooker, but &ldquo;weird&rdquo;. (Unclear
if this was released)</p>
<p>Pirahna&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2183">&ldquo;Roy of the Rovers&rdquo;</a> was due out at Easter.</p>
<p>Mirrorsoft were publishing Spectrum Holobyte&rsquo;s highly acclaimed flight sim
<a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1284">&ldquo;Falcon&rdquo;</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>Poole based Super X had developed a new hydraulic simulator that could hold 14
people. Costing a mere Â£70,000 it was aimed squarely at amusement parks,
shopping malls and museums.</p>
<p>Mattel had stirred up some controversy with a line of high tech toys
accompanying its &ldquo;Captain Power&rdquo; TV show. The show was &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; in that a
special light gun could be used to rack up points by shooting targets. These
targets, however, were people which lead to allegations of training kids to
kill humans&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Channel 4 had started a new series on the sport of Sumo wrestling and C&amp;VG
investigated &ldquo;the bizarre spectacle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The moves reviewed this month were: &ldquo;Empire of the Sun&rdquo;, &ldquo;Someone to Watch
Over Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Princess Bride&rdquo;, &ldquo;Asterix in Britain&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Orphans&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tony Takoushi interviewed Bruce Lowry, the head of Nintendo UK.</p>
<p>Tony Takoushi raved about <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2270">&ldquo;Garrison Two&rdquo;</a> for the Amiga and (correctly)
speculated that with the arrival of powerful computers and consoles, arcade
companies would move away from producing arcade machines and instead focus of
home computer/console games.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001196">&ldquo;Cybernoid&rdquo;</a> Hewson - Spectrum/Amstrad 9/10 &ldquo;Cybernoid is one of the best Spectrum releases for ages and probably the best Amstrad game around at the moment.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003863">&ldquo;Predator&rdquo;</a> Activision - Spectrum 9/10 &ldquo;All in all, Predator is an excellent game where the hunter becomes the hunted. Buy it and experience fear.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005774">&ldquo;Xarax&rdquo;</a> Firebird - Spectrum 8/10 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible Firebird could have put this out a higher [sic] price. But that&rsquo;s their blunder and your good fortune. Don&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the mouth, as they say.&rdquo; (The review also spelled &ldquo;Xarax&rdquo; as &ldquo;Zarax&rdquo;)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1329">&ldquo;io&rdquo;</a> Firebird - C64 8/10 &ldquo;io is the work of two well known Compunet art page supremo&rsquo;s - Bob Stevenson and Douglas Hare. If you like shoot &rsquo;em ups, you will not want to be without io - it is one of the best.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=983">&ldquo;Frightmare&rdquo;</a> Cascade - C64 8/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Frightmare is definitely a step in the right direction for Cascade. But remember, sweet dreams are not made out of this&hellip;&rdquo; (I honestly have no idea what they meant)</li>
<li><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=85">&ldquo;Arkanoid&rdquo;</a> Discovery - Amiga 8/10 &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have an Amiga, this should be near the top of your list.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Oids&rdquo; FTL/Mirrorsoft - ST 8/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Any ST owner who has played Thrust will not want to be without Oids. My only criticism is the price.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2641">&ldquo;Thrust&rdquo;</a> was a Â£1.99 budget game which made the Â£39.99 price tag for Oids a little hard to swallow.)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Shades&rdquo; - MUD available for Prestel and Micronet subscribers 9/10 &ldquo;It is all great fun - more a way of life, perhaps, than an adventure game. Provided you can afford the phone bill, plus nearly Â£1 per hour, (there are connect-time charges during the daytime on weekdays, as well) then it&rsquo;s worth taking the risk that you won&rsquo;t become totally addicted to it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Dungeon Master&rdquo; FTL/Mirrorsoft - ST 9/10 &ldquo;I got over my initial doubts VERY quickly and have spent over 40 hours playing this game without a hint of boredom. A must for all roleplayers!&rdquo;</li>
