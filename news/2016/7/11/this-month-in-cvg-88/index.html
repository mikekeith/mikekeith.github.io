<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>The 1988 Euros were about to start and Grandslam were putting the finishing
touches on <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1914">&ldquo;Peter Beardsleyâ€™s International Football&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Titus was following up their <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1558">&ldquo;Crazy Cars&rdquo;</a> with <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2111">&ldquo;Fire and
Forget&rdquo;</a>, a vehicular combat game featuring cars decked out with an
array of weapons.</p>
<p>Crocodile Dundee was heading back to the cinemas, but this time his antics
would take place in New York.</p>
<p>German developer house Logotron was to release a heavily Defender inspired
shooter, <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1001">&ldquo;Stay Ray&rdquo;</a>, for the Amiga.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG&rsquo;s new design was obviously not the only change this month - they carried
news of New York Seltzer, supposedly the number one soft drink in the US&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1437">&ldquo;Netherworld&rdquo;</a> was Hewson&rsquo;s next game. It was being programmed by
Charlie T, aka The Flying Finn.</p>
<p>NEC&rsquo;s London office was being flooded with calls from people wanting to know
when the PC Engine would make it to the UK. Interestingly enough, NEC&rsquo;s vision
for the console wasn&rsquo;t as a games machine, but as the hub of more
sophisticated home entertainment systems.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG took a brief look at some of the new waterguns on the market&hellip;</p>
<p>The Comic of the Month was Alan Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;V for Vendetta&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=781">&ldquo;Dream Warrior&rdquo;</a> from US Gold would see the player take on hoards of
Dream Demons in a run &amp; gun.</p>
<p>Hewson were throwing their hat in the battlecar genre with <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1595">&ldquo;Marauder&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG got a bit of a slap on the wrist from Nintendo after including a Mario
badge on the cover of last month&rsquo;s issue without permission.</p>
<p>Spectrum strategy fans could look forward to <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004808">&ldquo;The Battle for
Stalingrad&rdquo;</a> from CCS.</p>
<p>Fantasy artists Tim White and Chris Achilleos both had new collections out.</p>
<p>Loriciels in France had instituted new security procedures for dealing with
any software sent to them. Any new disks arriving would first go through an
&ldquo;isolation ward&rdquo;, and they had already caught one case of a hoax game that was
intended to spread a destructive virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phantasm&rdquo; was a new 3D shoot-&rsquo;em up from Exocet (never released?).</p>
<p>A fat, greedy car park attendant isn&rsquo;t the most likely of game heroes, but that&rsquo;s precisely what Grandslam&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000954">&ldquo;Chubby Gristle&rdquo;</a> was. The software house was also working <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003855">&ldquo;Power Pyramids&rdquo;</a> (&ldquo;a sophisticated version of pinball&rdquo;), a series of Thunderbirds games, and a computer version of the board game <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001654">&ldquo;Espionage&rdquo;</a>. While there had previously been two failed attempts, they planned to resurrect the Bug Byte name for budget re-releases.</p>
<p>Domark had a hit on their hands with the home computer versions of <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1470">&ldquo;Star
Wars&rdquo;</a>, so it was no surprise they were working on <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=373">&ldquo;The Empire Strikes
Back&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lucas&hellip; the movie <a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2618">&ldquo;Willow&rdquo;</a> had been turned into a game.</p>
<p>The Society of Software Authors had been founded to support workers in the
games industry. &ldquo;Overworked, exploited, ripped off and generally
unappreciated&rdquo; - how times change.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG was obviously getting a bit sick of car combat games, with their snarky
comments about Martech&rsquo;s &ldquo;Car Wars 3&rdquo; (I can&rsquo;t find any mention of any &ldquo;Car
Wars&rdquo; games).</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Movies reviewed in this issue were: &ldquo;Suspect&rdquo;, &ldquo;Throw Momma from the Train&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Cop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Prison&rdquo;, &ldquo;Maybe Baby&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shy People&rdquo;, &ldquo;Man on Fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wings of
Desire&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Justin Edward Swords from Coventry won the first ever C&amp;VG Winner Stays On
videogame competition.</p>
<p>John Minson described at length the time he met Batman (Adam West).</p>
<h2 id="notable-previews">Notable Previews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=215">&ldquo;Barbarian II: The Dungeons of Drax&rdquo;</a> Palace Software</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1489">&ldquo;Last Ninja II&rdquo;</a> System 3 - Spectrum/C64 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Ninja II is one of the best sequels I have seen. It works because the designers were brave enough to stick to the same basic concept.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001827">&ldquo;Football Manager II&rdquo;</a> Prism - Spectrum/C64/Amstrad/Amiga/ST 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Football Manager II is simply a football fan&rsquo;s dream come true. It&rsquo;s a beautifully structured and presented game and is engrossing, challenging and very, very addictive - it had me burning the midnight oil several nights running!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Gauntlet II&rdquo; US Gold - ST 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;The gameplay is superb, and again it&rsquo;s totally faithful to the original. I&rsquo;ve spent many hours fighting through Gauntlet II&rsquo;s 100 levels, and can honestly say that it&rsquo;s one of the finest arcade conversions I&rsquo;ve ever seen - don&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=814">&ldquo;Pandora&rdquo;</a> Firebird - Amiga/ST/C64 9/10 &ldquo;Certainly not a game you can expect to finish quickly, then. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s so much to see that there&rsquo;s not a chance of getting bored.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001261">&ldquo;Darkside&rdquo;</a> Incentive - Spectrum/Amstrad/C64 10/10 &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t already clear from this really inadequate review, Dark Side is absolutely stunning.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=476">&ldquo;Great Giana Sisters&rdquo;</a> Rainbow Arts - Amiga C&amp;VG Hit 9/10 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it really, a bloody good game, and if it didn&rsquo;t get Game of the Month, it&rsquo;s only because we were loath to give it to such an obvious filch.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=398">&ldquo;Interceptor&rdquo;</a> Electronic Arts - Amiga 8/10 &ldquo;Interceptor is destined to become a benchmark against which future products of the type will be judged. If you like this kind of game and you own an Amiga then buy it at your first opportunity.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1557">&ldquo;Corruption&rdquo;</a> Magnetic Scrolls/Rainbird - Amiga/ST/PC 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Here is a game that Magnetic Scrolls is not urging people to rush out and buy. They recognise that it is a completely different genre from their previous titles, and, while they hope their fans will like it, would prefer them to read reviews and think carefully whether or not it&rsquo;s their type of adventure before deciding.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Shadowgate&rdquo; Mirrorsoft - ST 10/10 &ldquo;Great entertainment, with surprises and puzzles all along the way!&rdquo;</li>
