<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Editor Andy Nuttall reckoned this issue was &ldquo;more fruitsome and lovely than
ever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A new contender for acquiring Commodore entered the ring: Escom, who had put
in a bid for Â£5 million. The Commodore UK team downplayed this saying the bid
was low and their own offer was still favourite. Meanwhile, Escom had bought
out failed UK high street shop chain Rumbelows.</p>
<p>Retailer Silica were staying the course with their Amiga sales and launched a
new CD32 bundle.</p>
<p>Battery maker Duracell had produced &ldquo;The Duracell Challenge&rdquo; - a free game
which they hoped would &ldquo;harness piracy&rdquo; to spread&hellip; there was prize money at
stake and apparently every consumer who provided the game to an eventual
winner would get a share. The interesting bit was that it was developed by The
Mounties, who had been setup by none other than Mel Croucher (of Automata/Pi
Man fame) to focus on interactive advertising. Oh, and it was PC only at the
time of publication.</p>
<p>The UK was about to get a new terrestrial TV channel in the form of Channel 5,
but the frequency could cause interference with Amiga RF cables.</p>
<p>The Monopolies and Mergers Commission slapped Nintendo and Sega on the wrists
for: &ldquo;&hellip; setting high prices on software and unrealistically low prices on
hardware, charging third parties too much to manufacture the games, wielding
too much power over other publishers, outlawing rental when they shouldn&rsquo;t and
putting complex electronics into consoles to stop others producing software
for them.&rdquo; And those stern words were the extent of the punishment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1870">&ldquo;Coala&rdquo;</a> was a new helicopter flight sim from Empire.</p>
<p>Kompart Krew had provided some teasers of a bunch of new games they were publishing for the Amiga: <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2724">&ldquo;Tower of Souls&rdquo;</a>, &ldquo;Chess Through the Ages&rdquo; (unreleased?), <a href="https://hol.abime.net/3953">&ldquo;Evil&rsquo;s Doom&rdquo;</a> (developed by Croteam, unreleased) and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1597">&ldquo;Turbo Trax&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;rather raw-looking press release&rdquo; from Cobra Developments heralded the
release of &ldquo;For The Love Of Money&rdquo; for the CD32 which promised a &ldquo;perfect
balance of arcade action and adventure.&rdquo; (unreleased?)</p>
<p>Games industry trade show ECTS drew record crowds (8,500 over the three days),
though the only stands with new Amiga wares were Team 17, Black Legend and
Renegade. At the ECTS awards Bullfrog cleaned up, with &ldquo;Magic Carpet&rdquo; winning
best home computer game and most original title of the year.</p>
<p>Buried in the ECTS news was mention of Team 17 striking a deal with Ocean to
provide more funds for development.</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s Science Museum had a new exhibition which would allow visitors to
experience the &ldquo;information superhighway&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A study by Plymouth University psychologist Mark Griffiths concluded that
games could be beneficial for kids with &ldquo;brain disorders, behavioural problems
and arm injuries.&rdquo; Apparently they could also cure &ldquo;chronic nose pickers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Spotlight Show which focussed on the Amiga was going ahead at London&rsquo;s
Novotel hotel on June 10th and 11th. Though the fact that Commodore were
listed as one of the exhibitors did raise eyebrows.</p>
<p>US Gold&rsquo;s budget label KIXX were releasing a new batch of re-releases,
including <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=985">&ldquo;Speedball&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1151">&ldquo;Xenon 2&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=573">&ldquo;Robocod&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2819">&ldquo;Tennis
Cup 2&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1054">&ldquo;Thunderblade&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2309">&ldquo;Pizza Tycoon&rdquo;</a> MicroProse - 88% &ldquo;There are lots of silly things that keep PT from just becoming a repetitive management game, and if you hire managers for your restaurants you don&rsquo;t have to keep worrying about ordering enough tomatoes once you get involved in challenges and espionage.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1193">&ldquo;Exile (AGA)&rdquo;</a> Audiogenic - 86% &ldquo;The game scores highly in the &lsquo;sheer fun&rsquo; department, with lots of action and reward. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see Exile receive a varied range of scores, as it nostalgically scores well, can also impress the first time player, but may fall when compared to the original or modern-day competitors.&rdquo;</li>
