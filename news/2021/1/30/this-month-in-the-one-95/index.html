<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Apparently the higher ups at EMAP were putting pressure on The One to cut back
on pages and coverdisks, but Acting Editor Andy Nuttall and team stood firm,
delivering a bumper issue. It wasn&rsquo;t without its price, tho: &ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s taken
us ages longer than normal to write, the coverdisks nearly killed us, and
getting in the finished version of SWOS for review was a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fate of Commodore remained up in the air, with little news to be had. The
only new development of interest being that US-based Creative Equipment
International had put up a $1 million deposit as a first step towards an
acquisition. Commodore UK&rsquo;s team remained the main other contender.</p>
<p>Always hard to know if this was a sign of a slow news month, but two new
lottery number picking applications were available from OnLine PD.</p>
<p>BT was to trial interactive TV in 2,500 homes in Colchester, promising on
demand movies, grocery shopping, home banking and more. They also hoped to add
pay to play gaming.</p>
<p>The interestingly named MPEG company were to bring a series of porn Video CDs
to market that were compatible with digital video cart equipped CD32s. Titles
included &ldquo;Back to Melrose Place&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quantum Deep&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A TV ad campaign that featured &ldquo;robots gatecrashing scenes of fifties dancing
and gaiety, along with the line &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t dance with broken legs&rsquo;&rdquo; was enough
to get the <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1792">&ldquo;Rise of the Robots&rdquo;</a> commercial a ban from being shown
during religious and kid&rsquo;s programmes.</p>
<p>American retailer Microplay were to open a store in Birmingham offering
customers the ability to exchange and sell games. It seems this practice had
been frowned on by industry lawyers, so people were uncertain of how long it&rsquo;d
last.</p>
<p>Anco announced the next instalment in the Kick Off series, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1418">&ldquo;Kick Off 3 -
European Challenge&rdquo;</a> which would boast a bevy of new features, including
teams playing in the style they&rsquo;re known for.</p>
<p>Adventure gamers were in for a bit of a treat with budget label Kixx launching
two new compilations, both priced at £29.99. The first included five classic
LucasArts adventures: <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=935">&ldquo;The Secret of Monkey Island&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=559">&ldquo;Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1162">&ldquo;Zak McKracken and the Alien
Mindbenders&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=691">&ldquo;Loom&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=717">&ldquo;Maniac Mansion&rdquo;</a>. The second
featured a series of Delphine games: <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=414">&ldquo;Flashback&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=72">&ldquo;Another
World&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=283">&ldquo;Cruise for a Corpse&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2440">&ldquo;Operation Stealth&rdquo;</a> and
<a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1285">&ldquo;Future Wars&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Chelsea Football Club had sued Commodore for £119,000, which they felt they
were owed after they reached the 1994 FA Cup Final. Commodore reckoned they
were being &ldquo;extremely cheeky&rdquo;, especially since the club had only provided a
few tickets, having to pay for others.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1193">&ldquo;Exile&rdquo;</a> was set to get a bit of a make over for its re-release,
targeting the AGA machines and CD32.</p>
<p>Team 17 had high hopes for their new game, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1149">&ldquo;Worms&rdquo;</a>, due out in April
for the 1200 and CD32. They also revealed <a href="https://hol.abime.net/4427">&ldquo;Pussies Galore&rdquo;</a>, a
platformer involving - I think - rescuing kittens (unreleased).</p>
<p>The hugely anticipated <a href="https://hol.abime.net/5675">&ldquo;Frontier: First Encounters&rdquo;</a> got a few new
screenshots&hellip; except they were from the PC version. Was that a bad omen for
Amiga fans? (yes)</p>
<p>Apparently SDL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Critical Zone&rdquo; CD32 bundle (console + 7 games) was flying
off the shelves.</p>
<p>Psygnosis looked to clear out a load of old stock, selling around 50 titles
for between £4.99 and £9.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=538">&ldquo;Rise of the Robots&rdquo;</a> CD32 was off to a strong start, claiming the
number 2 best selling CD game spot (behind &ldquo;Mega Race&rdquo; for the Mega CD).</p>
<p>Media companies began to take some interest in some new fangled Internet
thing.</p>
<p>There was to be a US only release of a Mortal Kombat album, with tracks based
on each of the fighters.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=762">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat II&rdquo;</a> Probe/Acclaim - 90% &ldquo;The Amiga conversion is damn-near identical to the Mega Drive game, and what it lacks in animated backgrounds it more than makes up for with a plethora of deep-throated samples, some of which were sadly missing from the Mega Drive.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=539">&ldquo;Roadkill&rdquo;</a> Acid Software/Guidhall - 90% (CD32) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the lack of complex gameplay, Roadkill is brilliant. Though basically nothing more than an overhead racing game with brass knobs on, it scores 100 percent in the atmosphere and overall feel department.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1629">&ldquo;Marvin&rsquo;s Marvellous Adventure&rdquo;</a> Infernal Bytes Systems/21s Century - 82% (A1200) &ldquo;Had Marvin been absolutely brilliantly designed then this would have been perfect, and certainly almost equalled the Mario games in terms of pure, unadulterated gaming fun.&rdquo; (A good mate of mine and brilliant programmer coded this)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1178">&ldquo;Dreamweb&rdquo;</a> Creative Reality/Empire - 85% (A1200) &ldquo;Without the atmospherics there&rsquo;s not a enough depth of either gameplay or characters in Dreamweb to hold your attention for long periods of time.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1181">&ldquo;The All New World of Lemmings&rdquo;</a> DMA Design/Psygnosis - 89% (A1200) &ldquo;To be honest, though, I never found Lemmings 1 or 2 particularly easy or comfortable to control; so this all-new control system with a small number of huge icons that are easy to hit with the mouse are right up my fenêtre, as Matt would say.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">&ldquo;Sensible World of Soccer&rdquo;</a> Sensible Software/Renegadde - 90% &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped to give SWOS a higher mark, but would be lying if I said I&rsquo;d been totally blown away by it. Still, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, SWOS is absolutely fab; just don&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s not quite as stunning as you&rsquo;d hoped.&rdquo; (Personally I strongly disagree with this - SWOS still stands as one of the greatest games ever made)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=4207">&ldquo;Whizz&rdquo;</a> Flair - 81% &ldquo;Whizz, though, is faster than the first [Head over Heels], and prettier than the second [Crystal Castles] - and despite being a standard platformer at heart, the isometric perspective tricks your mind into thinking it&rsquo;s playing something revolutionary.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1188">&ldquo;Sim City 2000&rdquo;</a> Maxis - 80% (A1200) &ldquo;Surely this gane is the result of laziness on Maxis&rsquo; behalf. Come on guys, we want to see games that take advantage of the Amiga&rsquo;s strengths, not direct ports from the PC.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1452">&ldquo;Pinball Illusions&rdquo;</a> Digital Illusions/21st Century - 91% (A1200) &ldquo;And multiball&hellip; well, since I heard about Illusions I&rsquo;ve been wondering how they&rsquo;d do it, and the flip between lo- and hi-res modes works astonishingly well. Yes, my friends, Pinball&rsquo;s back. And this time it&rsquo;s brought its friends&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=58">&ldquo;Alien Breed: Tower Assault&rdquo;</a> Team 17 - 86% &ldquo;I guess what you really want to know is whether Tower Assault more of the same, or something all fresh and sparkly. Well, you can paint me in creosote for sitting on the fence, but the truth is that it&rsquo;s a bit of both.&rdquo;</li>
