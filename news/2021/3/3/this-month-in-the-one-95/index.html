<p>Andy Nuttall officially took over the Editor role.</p>
<p>If you thought that the future of Commodore would be sorted out by this month,
then you were sorely mistaken. The end did seem in sight (something that had
been said for nearly a year), with only Commodore UK and US-based CEI
remaining in the running. Meanwhile retailers were getting frustrated with the
lack of new stock. With that said, apparently 82% of stores surveyed were keen
to continue selling the machines (if they were provided some to sell&hellip;).</p>
<p>The UK government warned game publishers that they would now be required to
submit all titles for certification.</p>
<p>A player&rsquo;s guide to <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=676">&ldquo;Lemmings&rdquo;</a> was on the way from Kuma.</p>
<p>Ocean had grown tired of clamouring for attention in the saturated end of year
market and decided to space out new releases throughout the year, starting
with <a href="https://hol.abime.net/1367">&ldquo;TFX&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Research by Professor Stephen Heppeli showed that playing games improved the
problem solving skills of children.</p>
<p>The World of Amiga had proven a success, with an estimated 5,000
visitors/punters on each of the three days. Commodore UK had held back 250
A1200s just for the show, and all were sold within the first morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=938">&ldquo;Sensible Golf&rdquo;</a> had been delayed until April.</p>
<p>It looked like the days of the medium software houses may be coming to an end,
with the big media companies entering the market and making acquisitions. In
order to compete, the Ocean took investment from French media giant Chargeurs,
Virgin from Blockbuster, US Gold went public and Gremlin was contemplating a
similar move.</p>
<p>The game industry police (?) arrested Robert Butler, the sysop of the Krypt
BBS. He was fined Â£500 and had all his gear confiscated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=945">&ldquo;Sensible World of Soccer&rdquo;</a> was triumphant in the Christmas sales
charts, moving 50,000 copies across Europe on just the first day. <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1792">&ldquo;Rise of
the Robots&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=762">&ldquo;Mortal Kombat II&rdquo;</a> were next in line. Ocean
sold 20,000 copies each of <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1180">&ldquo;Jungle Strike&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3327">&ldquo;PGA European Tour
Golf&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Matthew Brailsford was crowned <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1459">&ldquo;Premier Manager 2&rdquo;</a> Manager of the
Year.</p>
<p>The band Genesis invested in Alternative Software&rsquo;s CD startup, Quicksilver,
which had started releasing discs for the CD32.</p>
<p>Elsewhere another musician, Feargal Sharkey, began working for record label
ESP who were producing &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; albums.</p>
<p>The British Computer Society created an Internet site to provide information
on tailor-made peripherals catering for users with disabilities.</p>
<p>A VR headset which allowed disabled users to experience public transport in
order to build up their confidence had been developed by Division.</p>
<p>Interactive was a new games focussed TV show appearing on Channel One, the
UK&rsquo;s first cable news network.</p>
<p>Technics released the SC-VC10 - the world&rsquo;s first VideoCD compatible
minisystem - in the US.</p>
<p>Empire software were to produce a new compilation pack, &ldquo;Award Winners
Platinum&rdquo;, consisting of <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1782">&ldquo;Frontier: Elite 2&rdquo;</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1177">&ldquo;Civilisation&rdquo;</a>
and <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=676">&ldquo;Lemmings&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2862">&ldquo;Manchester United: The Double&rdquo;</a> was the follow up to Krisalis&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1770">&ldquo;Manchester United: Premier League Champions&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Beat&rsquo;em up <a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=364">&ldquo;Elfmania&rdquo;</a> was to begin appearing as a comic strip in Manga
fanzine &ldquo;Animenia&rdquo;.</p>

<p>On this month&rsquo;s two cover disks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1629">&ldquo;Marvin&rsquo;s Marvellous Adventure&rdquo;</a> 21st Century (A1200) (demo)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2707">&ldquo;Shadow Fighter&rdquo;</a> Gremlin (demo)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a slightly odd take on the interview format, Digital Image Design&rsquo;s Nick
Clarkson first sat down for a chat with one of the staff and was then
subjected to a session with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2707">&ldquo;Shadow Fighter&rdquo;</a> NAPS/Gremlin - 91% &ldquo;For someone wanting a Street Fighter 2 copy, this has everything; right from the slow-motion knock-out strikes to the &lsquo;Round One. Fight!&rsquo; announcer. The special moves, in-game tunes, spot effects, and animations (with that stunning background parallax!) really just add more icing to the icing to the icing, leaving you wondering why no one has done this before.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1173">&ldquo;Bloodnet&rdquo;</a> Gametek - 84% &ldquo;Overall, I liked this game a lot, and if you have the necessary hardware (one for game-starved A4000 owners), like adventure games, and are familiar with cyber-speak, buy it.&rdquo; (Apparently running from floppy required 28 disk swaps to reach the game&hellip;)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=654">&ldquo;Flink&rdquo;</a> Psygnosis - 87% &ldquo;Flink, has no such option [in game saves, passwords etc], and so while playing through the game is an absolute joy, dying and having to return to the beginning each time soon becomes tedious.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=3708">&ldquo;On the Ball: League Edition&rdquo;</a> Ascon/Daze - 87% &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t score this version as highly as I did with the first game simply because the WC edition was a revelation. This, however, is, and though still clever, is more of a data package than a sequel or alternative.&rdquo;</li>
