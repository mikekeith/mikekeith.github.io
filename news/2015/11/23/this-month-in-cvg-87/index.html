<h2 id="news">News</h2>
<p>Microprose&rsquo;s &ldquo;F-15 Strike Eagle&rdquo; was about to land on the ST. The ST would
also get a port of Mirrorsoft&rsquo;s flightsim featuring a somewhat older aircraft,
&ldquo;Spitfire 40&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Viz were working on <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2830">&ldquo;Werewolves of London&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>For the first time since being bought out by Mastertronic, Melbourne House
announced its upcoming titles: <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=903">&ldquo;Roadwars&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=3094">&ldquo;Rockford&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2018">&ldquo;Pulse
Warrior&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2499">&ldquo;Street Hassle&rdquo;</a>, &ldquo;Metropolis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kelly X&rdquo; (I was
unable to find any sign that the latter two were released, at least not under
those names).</p>
<p>There was a screenshot from EA&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=484">&ldquo;Chuck Yeager&rsquo;s Advanced Flight
Simulator&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Probe&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000683">&ldquo;Bravestarr&rdquo;</a> - a game based on the cartoon series of the same
name - was due out on the Spectrum in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>The game license for the <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1935">&ldquo;Pink Panther&rdquo;</a> had been picked up. The bit in
the mag about this was done in a very strained French accent and was quite
difficult to comprehend. I <em>think</em> they were trying to say that Ollersoft had
the rights, but I have no idea who Ollersoft were (if indeed they existed) and
the game was actually published by Gremlin.</p>
<p>Cinemaware&rsquo;s next movie-esque game - this time featuring gangsters - would be
<a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1272">&ldquo;King of Chicago&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Early &rsquo;80s Whizz Kid poster boy Eugene Evans had resurfaced and was working on <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=1378">&ldquo;Bermuda Project&rdquo;</a> (Amiga/ST/Mac) for Mirrorsoft.</p>
<p>Martin Deem from Stubbington took away the first prize in C&amp;VG&rsquo;s arcade
competition held at the Personal Computer World Show. Runners up were Darren
Parker from Doncaster, and Andrew Hall Davies from Redditch.</p>
<p>Also taking place at the PCW Show was Mastertronic&rsquo;s international arcade
champs (to celebrate the launch of their own Arcadia range of coin-ops.. I
never realised they got into coin-ops). It was the US team vs the UK team,
with the latter taking away the honours.</p>
<p>Gremlin had a packed Christmas line up: <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1604">&ldquo;MASK II&rdquo;</a>,
<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005797">&ldquo;Compendium&rdquo;</a>, <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=102">&ldquo;Alternative World Games&rdquo;</a>, and <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000430">&ldquo;Basil The Great
Mouse Detective&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Another screenshot of Incentive&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001521">&ldquo;Driller&rdquo;</a>. The software
house boasted that there would be 20,000 billion screen possibilities. What on
earth did that mean?!</p>
<p>Not much had been heard from the ever intriguing ladies of St Bride&rsquo;s over the
past year or so, but they announced their next adventure was to be the
gruesome (and somewhat controversial) <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1348">&ldquo;Jack the Ripper&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Ocean were throwing their hat into the 16bit ring with a rather interesting
game in the form of <a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=2065">&ldquo;ECO&rdquo;</a>, though I don&rsquo;t think I ever understood what
I was doing. Ocean had also secured the rights to <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1567">&ldquo;Madballs&rdquo;</a>,
meanwhile Imagine were to release <a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=975">&ldquo;Freddie Harvest&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin Toms revealed the long awaited <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0001827">&ldquo;Football Manager 2&rdquo;</a> at the PCW
Show (with help from West Brom&rsquo;s manager, Ron Atkinson).</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>This month&rsquo;s music reviews featured: Suicidal Tendencies, Slade, Bathory, Shy,
and Poison.</p>
<p>There was a Thundercat&rsquo;s short comic.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG attended the British Fantasy Society&rsquo;s FantasyCon.</p>
<p>The movies covered this month were: The Witches of Eastwick, Angel Heart, A
Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3, Beverly Hills Cop II, Who&rsquo;s That Girl, Private
Investigations, Dirty Dancing, Mascara, and Eat the Rich.</p>
<p>C&amp;VG visited the studio behind innovative TV adventure game show,
&ldquo;Knightmare&rdquo;, to see how they manage to put it all together.</p>
<p>The comics section took a look at the work of Moebius.</p>
<p>Tony Takoushi gushed over &ldquo;Nemesis 2&rdquo; for the 128K MSX, and made the rather
ridiculous claim that &ldquo;this game has music and sound effects that make the
industry standards of Rob Hubbard look like Noddy.&rdquo; Utter rubbish, Tony.</p>
<h2 id="notable-reviews">Notable Reviews</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1271">&ldquo;International Karate 2&rdquo;</a> Archer Maclean/System 3 - C64 10/10 Game of the Month &ldquo;Sound the fanfares and get the flags out for System 3&rsquo;s International Karate 2, the sequel that&rsquo;s more than equal to the original.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2559">&ldquo;Super Sprint&rdquo;</a> Electric Dreams - C64 9/10 &ldquo;The 64 version is excellent. It looks good, plays pretty much like the arcade machine and has sto [sic] many nice touches that you&rsquo;ll want to keep comeing [sic] back for more.&rdquo; Oh dear, Editor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=501">&ldquo;Hollywood Poker&rdquo;</a> Diamond Software - Amiga 8/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Hollywood Poker is the best strip poker game I have ever seen, heard and played.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2042">&ldquo;Quedex</a> Stavros Fasoulas/Thalamus - C64 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Quedex is pretty damn good - puzzling, frustrating and addictive all at once. Don&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1261">&ldquo;Hysteria&rdquo;</a> Special FX/Software Projects - C64/Spectrum 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;The Software Projects revival continues. Dragon&rsquo;s Lair (ok), Star Paws (getting better) and now Hysteria (great).&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002475">&ldquo;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&rdquo;</a> US Gold - Spectrum/Amstrad/ST 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Playability is great. Control of your character is smooth and easy, which is what I like best about this game.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0004082">&ldquo;Renegade&rdquo;</a> Imagine - Spectrum/C64/Amstrad 7/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Although the actual arcade original was nothing much to rave about, Imagine has done a marvellous job at converting it.&rdquo; A bizarre review.. really didn&rsquo;t sound like the reviewer enjoyed it at all.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sidewalk&rdquo; Infogrames - ST 7/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Sidewalk is a strange mixture of adventure and arcade, with stunning graphics, a novel, and sometimes annoying, control mechanism [sic], and the kind of humour and feel that will appeal to comic buffs, who may finally be persuaded that comics and computer games can be combined to provide a piece of genuine entertainment.&rdquo; Yes, that was one sentence - what the hell, Editor?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1591">&ldquo;Maniac Mansion&rdquo;</a> Lucasfilm/Activision - C64 9/10 &ldquo;A FUN adventure with original feel. Great graphics, good sound effects, nice animation and on top of all that it&rsquo;s totally addictive!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1941">&ldquo;Pirates!&rdquo;</a> Microprose - C64 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Pirates! is an impressive and absorbing game - one for those of you who enjoy getting all wrapped up in a strategy-style role-playing game with enough action to appeal to the arcadester.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Backlash&rdquo; Novagen - ST 10/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Luckily for you, Novagen&rsquo;s wizard programmer, Paul Woakes, has found time to produce Backlash [while working on the upcoming Damocles], a full-blooded, no-nonsense blaster.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2115">&ldquo;Red LED&rdquo;</a> Starlight - C64 9/10 &ldquo;Okay, despite the fact that Red LED&rsquo;s plot is about as thin as our ad manager&rsquo;s hair, we&rsquo;ve got a nifty little game on our hands here. Well done, Starlight. The best yet.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0005819">&ldquo;Yes, Prime Minister&rdquo;</a> Mosaic - Spectrum/BBC/C64/Amstrad 9/10 &ldquo;All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable and untaxing game, that is every bit as fun as watching the TV programme. Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorn and Derek Fowlds positively jump out of the screen.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Hunt&rdquo; Robico - BBC 9/10 C&amp;VG Hit &ldquo;Nice graphics, good text, logical puzzles, no sound (shame!) and a good plot.&rdquo;</li>
